Increasingly business students are recognized as possessing important skills that can drive social change. This new discipline is often referred to as Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create public goods. This is usually done through the generation of disequilibria in market and non-market environments. The S-ENT process can in some cases lead to the creation of social enterprises. These social ventures are hybrid organizations exhibiting characteristics of both the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs, a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited), they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality. A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital, for example, encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example, of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms, relative to the philanthropic investment made.','In this course you will learn how to create societal impact through Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create social change.

More recently, its scope has expanded to include things as diverse as data integrity, secure internet-wide communication, electronic cash, secure distributed computation, and more.Cryptography has also become ubiquitous. Perhaps unknowingly, we have all encountered applications of cryptography in our daily lives---whether by logging in using a password, making a web purchase over a secure connection, or applying a software update that is digitally signed.This course will introduce you to the foundations of modern cryptography, with an eye toward practical applications. We will learn the importance of carefully defining security; of relying on a set of well-studied “hardness assumptions” (e.g., the hardness of factoring large numbers); and of the possibility of proving security of complicated constructions based on low-level primitives. We will not only cover these ideas in theory, but will also explore their real-world impact.

Whether you are traveling, eating, working, doing business, shopping, surfing the Internet or breathing, all these activities are largely shaped by the EU.  As a result no global citizen, business leader, lawmaker, lobbyist or student can effectively operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique laboratory of integration. While the EU is often depicted as a monstrous bureaucratic creature, condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies, it remains the most accomplished experiment of economic, social and political integration in human history. In 50 years the EU accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize.Given its inherent complexities, Understanding Europe aims at popularizing the intricacies of the European Union system to promote greater awareness of the opportunities it offers you. Ultimately, you will not only better grasp the applicable framework for any European economic or social activity you engage in, but you will also participate on the EU stage. By confronting you with several current EU policy proposals, you will be able to ‘have a say’ in the EU policymaking process. We want to empower you as a citizen and business operator to maximize your rights and opportunities in today’s Europe.Understanding Europe is structured upon some basic yet critical questions about the EU’s purpose and legitimacy : why does the EU exist? How does it work? What can it offer you? The course then analyzes the European public sphere by focusing on its main actors (the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Court of Justice of the EU) and the role European citizens play in influencing Europe. We then move to the Union’s powers (what can the EU do? How far can it go? Do Members States have some instruments to “block” EU action? Can EU citizens challenge EU action?) by discussing the limits to its action and describing some of its policies. The course then analyzes the role and opportunities citizens and all stakeholders may have in shaping EU policies through public consultation, the European Citizens Initiative and other forms of participatory democracy. In a further step, we will analyze what the EU is doing for you regardless of where you are based in the world. Finally, by taking stock of what you have learned in the previous weeks, we will look at what you can do for and in Europe.Throughout the whole course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action. EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell us about their EU jobs. You can interact with the instructor and other participants, share your opinions, question the instructor’s assumptions and hence shape the course’s content. ','Learn about the European Union, how it works, why it matters and what it can offer you. Regardless of where you live, the EU not only affects your life but may also transform it.

Then we’ll see that muchof the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there\'snot much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genomeI’d see that they are 98.5% identical. It’s that 1.5% difference that we study todetermine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.  In the next few years you’ll be ableto get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at thechallenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge.

Our species, Homosapiens, was just one among them. Who were the others? Where did they comefrom? And what happened to them? Why is there today only one species of humans—Homosapiens? Lecture 2: The CognitiveRevolutionThe Cognitive Revolution, about70,000 years ago, enabled Homo sapiens to conquer the world and driveall other human species to extinction. During this revolution, Homo sapiensdeveloped a new and remarkable kind of language. How was this languagedifferent from the languages of earlier human species and of other animals? Whatwere the advantages that Homo sapiens gained from this unique language?  Lecture 3: Daily Life in theStone AgeWhat was life like for people wholived 30,000 years ago? What did they do when they woke up in the morning? Howdid they organize their societies? Did they have monogamous relationships andnuclear families? Did they have religions, revolutions, and wars? Lecture 4: The Human FloodFollowing the Cognitive Revolution,Homo sapiens spread all over the planet. While doing this, it drovenumerous other species to extinction. In Australia, up to 95% of all largeanimal species vanished. In America,84 of 107 large mammal species disappeared. Altogether, about half of the largeterrestrial mammals that populated Earth became extinct. How could a fewmillion individuals who possessed no more than Stone Age technology have causedsuch devastation?  Part II: The Agricultural Revolution  Lecture 5: History’s BiggestFraudAbout 12,000 years ago, people inthe Middle East, China, and Central America began domesticating plants and animals.In the process, Homo sapiens,too, was domesticated, abandoning a life of hunting and gatheringfor the pleasures and discomforts of agriculture. For most people, thediscomforts outweighed the pleasures. The Agricultural Revolution made the lifeof the average person harder. Why, then, did it occur? Lecture 6: Building PyramidsFor millions of years, humans livedin intimate bands of no more than a few dozen individuals. Our biologicalinstincts are adapted to this way of life. Humans are consequently ill-equippedto cooperate with large numbers of strangers. Yet shortly after the AgriculturalRevolution erupted, humans established cities, kingdoms, and huge empires. Howdid they do it? How can millions of strangers agree on shared laws, norms andvalues? Lecture 7: There is No Justicein History A critical factor in the formationof complex societies was the division of the population into a hierarchy ofgroups. Agricultural and industrial societies have been built on hierarchies ofclass, race, ethnicity, and gender. Why was it impossible to create a just andequal society? What is the deep root of prejudice and injustice? In particular,why did almost all known societies treat men as superior to women?   Part III: The Unification of Humankind Lecture 8: The Direction of HistoryAfter the Agricultural Revolution,humans created many different cultures and societies. The relations betweenthese different societies were very complex, and involved wars and conflicts aswell as trade, immigration and imitation. But as time went by, the connectionsbetween the societies became stronger and stronger, so that humankind wasgradually united into a single global society. Three main forces shaped thisprocess of unification. The first was money and trade. Money is the mostuniversal system of mutual trust ever devised by humans. How come even peoplewho believe in different gods and obey rival kings, are nevertheless willing touse the same money? Lecture 9: Imperial VisionsThe second force that shaped theprocess of human unification is imperialism. The idea of empire is seen todayin a very negative light, but empires have played such a central role in humanhistory that it’s hard to regard them as totally evil. What exactly is anempire? How have empires succeeded in uniting under their control differentecological regions, ethnic groups, and religious communities? How can webalance the positive contribution of empires with their record of violence andoppression? And what is the future of the imperial ideal? Is the world destinedto be ruled by a new global empire? Lecture 10: The Law of ReligionThe third force that shaped theprocess of human unification is religion. The role of religion in history isextremely controversial. Some see religion as the root of all evil, while forothers it is the primary source of happiness, empathy, and progress. Can wearrive at a balanced judgment? What were the main landmarks in the religioushistory of the world? In what ways did different cultures understand theuniverse, distinguish good from evil, and explain the ubiquitous presence ofsuffering?  Part IV. The Scientific Revolution Lecture 11: The Discovery ofIgnoranceDuring the last 500 years theprocess of human unification was completed. At the same time, there has been anexplosive growth in the power of humankind, due above all to the discoveries ofmodern science. Humankind has become increasingly convinced that the only thingthat limits its power is its own ignorance, and that the discovery of newknowledge can enable it to do almost anything. How is the modern scientifictradition different from all previous traditions of knowledge? What accountsfor its sudden rise and for its unparalleled achievements?  Lecture 12: The Marriage ofScience and EmpireModern science developed inalliance with the modern European empires. The conquest of new knowledgedepended upon and made possible the conquest of new territories. What exactlywas the contribution of science to the rise of the European empires, and whatwas the contribution of the European empires to the development of science? Andwhy did it all start in Europe, rather than in China,India, or the Middle East?  Lecture 13: The Capitalist CreedThe close ties between science andimperialism were in fact just one part of a more complex relationship. Thethird crucial member of this relationship was capitalism, which financed bothscience and empire, and which led to an unprecedented growth in the worldeconomy. How does a capitalist economy function? How is it different from traditionaleconomies? Is capitalism natural, or is it really a kind of religion? Lecture 14: The IndustrialRevolutionDuring the last 200 years, thecombination of science, imperialism and capitalism produced the IndustrialRevolution. This revolution gave humankind control of enormous new energyresources, and enabled humankind to start manufacturing far more things thanever before, far more quickly, and far more cheaply. How did this change theglobal ecology, daily life, and human psychology? Lecture 15: A PermanentRevolutionThe Industrial Revolution opened anera of permanent revolution. The late modern socio-political order is constantlychanging, never settling into any stable pattern. The pillars of humanorder—most notably, the family and the intimate community—are crumbling aroundus. How do humans deal with the resulting vacuum and chaos? How do society andpolitics function without stability? Is the world becoming more violent anddangerous, or is it actually more peaceful and secure than ever before?  Lecture 16: And They LivedHappily Ever After Have 500 years of amazing discoveries,developments, and revolutions made people happier? Are people today happierthan in the Middle Ages, or in the Stone Age? If not, what was the point of allthese changes? Most history books ignore these issues, yet these are the mostimportant questions we can ask about history. New studies in biology,economics, and psychology are offering fascinating insights into the history ofhuman happiness. Lecture 17: The End of Homo SapiensOver the last few decades humanshave began to bend and break the laws of natural selection—laws that havegoverned life on Earth for the past four billion years. New technologies suchas genetic engineering and nanotechnology are giving us unprecedented abilitiesto design not only the world around us, but also our own bodies, ourpersonalities, and our desires. How will this influence society and culture?Does anybody know where we are heading? What is the likely future of humankind?','About 2 million years ago our humanancestors were insignificant animals living in a corner of Africa. Their impact on the world was no greater thanthat of gorillas, zebras, or chickens. Today humans are spread all over theworld, and they are the most important animal around. The very future of lifeon Earth depends on the ideas and behavior of our species. This course will explain how we humans have conquered planet Earth, and howwe have changed our environment, our societies, and our own bodies and minds.The aim of the course is to give students a brief but complete overview ofhistory, and to answer some basic historical questions such as:            What isreligion?            What is anempire?             What ismoney?            What isscience?            What iscapitalism?                  Why did almostall societies believe that women are inferior to men?            Doeshistory have a direction?             Did peoplebecome happier as history progressed?             And what isthe likely future of humankind?

In a word, it, which belongs to the field of applicationcommunication studies, is to criticize media. With the technologyadvancing, the media industry developing and “social media” arriving,the media is playing a more and more important role in the modern society.To guarantee the positive development of the media itself, the mediaitself need to be restricted so as to make clear its boundary. Therefore,how to carry out the reflective judgment on the media and information isthe main problem of media criticism which still remains to be solved.Media criticism refers to reflective judgment, which bases on thecriticism of the value standpoint, the dissemination of the concept andthe theory background. Media criticism is the observation, analysis,evaluation, which is concluded from the humanities and social sciencefundamental research method, to the political and economy mechanism ofmedia, mass communication media agencies and media practitioners, thebasic form, media products, media text and the content, the audience. Inshort, media criticism is a research which base on the critical valuestandpoint in the media activities, media products and the concept ofcommunication.

In this most essential sense, energy is a basic human need.  We will consider how technological innovations have increased the ability of mankind to do work but only by increasing our demand for various sources of energy.  We will examine the determinants of demand for energy as well as the distribution of demand around the globe.Week 2 – Energy supplies and market allocations:  A broad range of primary sources are used to satisfy our need for energy.  Accessing these sources depends on many factors, including available technologies and skills, and a number of political factors.  We will address these factors as well as issues and trends in energy supply.Week 3 – Key capabilities for energy business:  In this week, we will more closely examine the various sources of fossil fuel energy such as coal, oil, gas as well as discuss the key business processes that affect their accessibility and use. Week 4-  Key capabilities for energy business:  In this week, we will more closely examine the various sources of alternative energy such as nuclear and renewable energy as well as discuss the key business processes that affect their accessibility and use.Week 5 – Key stakeholders in energy business:  Energy enterprises engage in complex activities with far-reaching consequences.  Consequently, these activities often motivate to action a diverse set of stakeholders.  We will examine the systemic nature of energy businesses and how it inevitably leads to engagement in political spheres.Week 6 – Strategic considerations in energy business:  In the concluding week of the course, we will consider the strategic implications of the economic, commercial, and political environment of energy.','This course provides anintroduction to the business of primary energy production.

At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence – inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This course will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage the learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology.Learning ObjectivesDevelop skills to apply IDSA guidelines in treating common infections such as acute rhino-sinusitis.Apply evidence based antibiotic management to treat sepsis.Implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship when providing care to special populations and in various settings.Apply evidence based antibiotic management to surgical patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis.Apply evidence based antibiotic stewardship program in the outpatient setting.Accreditation StatementThe Stanford University School of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians.AMA Credit Designation StatementThe Stanford University School of Medicine designates this enduring material for a maximum of 6.0 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)™.

The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You\'ll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they\'re being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You\'ll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We\'ll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances — and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we\'ll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it\'s applied intelligently.

Subsequently, the concept of discrete modelingof artificial vision tasks is introduced from theoretical view point along withshort examples demonstrating the interest of such an approach in low, mid andhigh-level vision. Examples refer to blind image deconvolution, knowledge-basedimage segmentation, optical flow, graph matching, 2d-to-3d view-point invariantdetection and modeling and grammar-driven image based reconstruction.Lecture2: Reparameterization and dynamic programming: In this lecture, we provide a brief introduction toundirected graphical models. We also provide a formal definition of the problemof inference (specifically, energy minimization). We introduce the concept ofreparameterization, which forms the building block of all the inferencealgorithms discussed in the course. We describe a simple inference algorithmknown as dynamic programming, which consists of a series of reparameterization.We show how dynamic programming can be used to perform exact inference onchains. Lecture3: Maximum flow and minimum cut:  In this lecture, we introduce the concept of functions on arcs of a directed graph. Wefocus on a special function known as the flow function. Associated with thisfunction is the combinatorial optimization problem of computing the maximumflow of a directed graph. We also introduce the concept of a cut in a directedgraph, and prove that the minimum cost cut is equivalent to the maximum flow.We describe a simple algorithm for solving the maximum flow, or equivalent theminimum cut, problem.Lecture4: Minimum cut based inference: In this lecture, we show how the problem of inference for undirectedgraphical models with two labels can be formulated as a minimum cut problem. Wecharacterize the energy function that can be minimized optimally using theminimum cut problem. We show examples using the image segmentation and texturesynthesis problems, which can be formulated using two labels. We consider themulti-label problem, and devise approximate algorithms for inference based onthe minimum cut algorithms. We show examples using the stereo reconstructionand the image denoising problems.Lecture5: Belief propagation: In this lecture we present the basic concepts ofmessage passing and belief propagation networks. The concept is initiallydemonstrated using chains, extended to the case of trees and then eventually toarbitrary graphs. The strengths and the limitations of such an optimizationframework are presented. The image completion and texture synthesis problemsare considered as examples to demonstrate the interest of such a family ofoptimization algorithms.Lecture6: Linear programing and duality:  In this lecture, discrete inference is addressed through concepts comingfrom linear programming relaxations. In particular, we explain how agraph-optimization problem can be expressed as a linear programing one and thenhow one can take benefit of the duality theorem to develop efficientoptimization methods. The problem of optical flow and its deformableregistration variant in medical image analysis is considered as an example todemonstrate the interest of such optimization algorithms.Lecture7: Dual decomposition and higher order graphs: In this lecture, we introduce the dual decompositionframework for the optimization of low rank and higher order graphical models.First, we demonstrate the concept of the method using a simple toy example andthen we extend to the most general optimization problem case. Three differentexamples are considered in the context of higher order optimization, theproblem of linear mapping between images, the case of dense deformable graphmatching and the development of pose invariant object segmentation methods inthe context of medical imaging.Lecture 8: Parameter learning: In this lecture, we introduce two frameworks for estimating the parametersof a graphical model using fully supervised training data. The first frameworkmaximizes the likelihood of the training data while regularizing theparameters. The second framework minimizes the empirical risk, as measured by auser-defined loss function, while regularizing the parameters. We provide abrief description of the algorithms required to solve the related optimizationproblems. We show the results obtained on standard machine learningdatasets.','Artificialvision applications, such as object detection in natural images and automaticsegmentation of medical acquisitions, rely on models that interpret the visualinformation provided to a computer. The model provides a compromise between thesupport given by the observations and the prior domain knowledge. This courseis concerned with the two computational problems that arise when using such modelsin practice.Inference(Energy Minimization):Given a visual observation (for example, an image or an MRI scan), weare interested in estimating its most likely interpretation (i.e. the location of allthe objects in the image, or the segments of the MRI scan) according to themodel. While the problem cannot be solved optimally, we will describe state of the art approximate algorithms that provide very accurate solutions inpractice. While the theoretical properties of the algorithms will be discussedbriefly, the main emphasis will be on their application. Learning(Parameter Estimation):Given a set of training samples consisting of inputs and their desiredoutputs, (for example, images and the location of the objects, or MRI scans andtheir segmentations) we would like to estimate a model that is suited to thetask at hand. We will show how the problem of learning a model can beformulated as empirical risk minimization. Furthermore, we will presentefficient algorithms for solving the corresponding optimization problem.','We will present the state of the art energy minimization algorithms that are used to perform inference in modern artificial vision models: that is, efficient methods for obtaining the most likely interpretation of a given visual input.

How would we deal with contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence and what would be the impact on society? Who would represent Earth?','Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks wondered if there were other worlds in the cosmos. This question is now being experimentally tested. This course, offered by the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh, is an introduction to astrobiology and was the first MOOC to explore this subject. It explores the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere. Astrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry.  In this course we will explore what we know about life’s ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection. The course will provide a foundation in astrobiology and introduce students to concepts in a diversity of scientific fields.','Learn about the origin and evolution of life and the search for life beyond the Earth.','3-4 hours/week','Charles Cockell','No background is required.','null','null'),(77,'91','Analytical Chemistry / Instrumental Analysis','https://www.coursera.org/course/analyticalchem','https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/analyticalchem/large-icon.png','rice','chemistry','en','Description: This course will provide students with a background in modern analytical chemistry with an emphasis on instrumentation. Applications of instrumental analytical chemistry in medicine, forensics and materials science will be presented. Course objectives:To reinforce chemical principles central to analytical chemistry.To introduce instrumental techniques for chemical measurement.To develop critical thinking for interpreting analytical data.To select instrumentation appropriate to the measurement need.Week 1: Overview of instrumental analysis and basic chemistry review Week 2: Atomic spectroscopies and the analysis of metals Week 3: Calibration, QA/QC, and improving instrumental analysis Week 4: The basic principles of chromatography Week 5: Gas chromatography Week 6: Liquid chromatography Week 7: Vibrational spectroscopies Week 8: Electronic and optical sensors','This course covers about a half a semester of instrumental analysis which is a standard part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Any chemist has to understand how to analyze samples - whether they are water samples, blood samples or bits of a painting. Most often chemists do this using instruments of some sort. Machines like mass spectrometers or gas chromatographs can indicate both what\'s in a sample (qualitative) as well as how much of something there is(quantitative). If you are fascinated by shows like CSI, and have enough basic chemistry, this course would be great for you. However, the course is first and foremost designed for chemistry students working towards their degree.Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes, but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally, students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method, and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.','If chemistry is the science of stuff, then analytical chemistry answers the question: what is it? And how much of it do you have? This course teaches how to do this with instrumental analysis!

The fundamental concepts will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University and utilizing a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project.  In this approach, rather than simply telling you the concepts you need to know and then asking you to memorize them or apply them, we will develop these concepts from experimental observations and scientific reasoning.  There are several reasons for using this approach.  One reason is that most of us our inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  A third reason is that this is simply more interesting.  The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.','This introduction to fundamental chemical concepts of atomic and molecular structure will emphasize the development of these concepts from experimental observations and scientific reasoning.','4-6 hours/week','John Steven Hutchinson','The class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry.

Section 1: Applying patterns and frameworks to develop scalable and secure cloud services, which uses an open-source cloud service as a running example to illustrate patterns and frameworks pertaining to service access, mobile/cloud communication, request routing, session handling, data persistence, concurrency and synchronization, synchronous and asynchronous event handling, and security. The bulk of the examples are in Java using the Spring Framework and Jetty middleware platform. The examples can be run on Google App Engine and Amazon EC2.    The PDF and PowerPoint versions of all the slides used in the course will be available online as the videos become available on the course website.','This MOOC describes by example how to connect Android mobile devices to clouds via the use of object-oriented design techniques, Java programming language features,Jetty middleware, Java Servlets, the Java Spring Framework,and cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine.An extended case study project will be used throughout the MOOC to showcase architectures for communicating with the cloud using HTTP, server-side processing of mobile data using servlets and the Java Spring Framework, and scalable storage of data usingno-SQL databases and other platforms.Because of the importance of building secure and scalable mobile/cloud platforms, this MOOC will not only show you how to program handheld systems that talk to the cloud, but how to do so securely, scalably, and efficiently. Security and scalability topicswill be woven into discussions of cloud service creation so that students learn, from the start, how to create robust cloud services for mobile devices. Although the cloud service topics in this course will be taught in the context of connecting mobile devices to the cloud, the concepts are broader and will give students the ability to create the cloud services to support large-scale web applications,such as social networking applications; cloud services for embedded systems, such as the Internet of Things and Industrial Internet; and wearable computing devices, such as Google Glass.

They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.The algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach will be hands-on, with six two week projects, each of which will involve implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender.In addition to topical lectures, this course includes interviews and guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry.Two Ways to Take this Course:This course is designed to support two different types of students and educational goals:Programming Track:  Designed for students with significant programming and mathematics experience (see below), the programming track combines a conceptual and mathematical understanding of recommender systems with experience programming six different recommender systems projects.  Students completing this travel will gain the skills needed to implement basic recommenders from scratch, and to use software libraries and tools to implement more advanced recommenders.Concepts Track:  Students who are not experienced programmers, or who are primarily interested in understanding the concepts and techniques of recommender systems, without learning to program them, can choose to focus on the conceptual and mathematical content, skipping the programming projects and associated lecture content.  Students in the concepts track are still expected to have significant familiarity with computing systems and college-level mathematics, but need not be accomplished programmers.  We expect this track to be useful for tech-savvy marketing and business leaders, as well as engineering managers who may oversee but not directly develop recommender systems.  We also hope it will be useful to those looking to understand recommender systems concepts without the workload associated with programming those systems.  ','This course introduces the concepts, applications, algorithms, programming, and design of recommender systems--software systems that recommend products or information, often based on extensive personalization.

Many code examples are shown throughout using Java, witha case study project used to reify the key points throughout all themodules in this section.The PDF and PowerPoint versions of all the slides used in the course will be available online as the videos become available on the course website.','The confluence of multi-core and distributed-core processors, inexpensive mass storage, ubiquitous wireless connectivity, and commodity software platforms is driving the need for software engineers and programmers who understand how to develop    concurrent and networked software for mobile devices that connect to cloud computing platforms. Despite many improvements in processors, storage, and networks, however, developing quality software on-time and on-budget remains hard. Moreover,    developing high quality reusable concurrent and networked software apps and services is even harder.  The principles, methods, and skills required to develop such software are best learned by attaining mastery of patterns, pattern languages,    and frameworks.    A pattern describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form a pattern language that    defines a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. A framework is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable    architecture for a family of related apps or services.  Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code.    This MOOC describes by example how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques,    Javaprogramming language features, and Android middleware. An extended case study project    will be used throughout the MOOC to showcase pattern-oriented software design and programming techniques for concurrent and networked mobile devices and clouds.Note: This course is part of a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs entitled Mobile Cloud Computing with AndroidThis MOOC and two others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera    platform, structured as follows:    The University of Maryland MOOC, Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems, will start on January 21st, 2014. It focuses on the design and programming of user-facing        applications.      The first Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems, will start on April 2nd. It focuses on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous        and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services.      The second Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems, will be start on June 15th, 2014. It focuses on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud        computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2.            Some of the programming assignments and the course project for these MOOCs will be coordinated.     If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper,    end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.','In this course--the second in a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs on Mobile Cloud Computing with Android--we will learn how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked services on mobile devices running Android that connect to popular cloud computing platforms.

This means that being able to design programs    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming    a more and more valuable skill.To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general    skill of how to design a program.This course presents a design method that will enable you to approach    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop    in the future.Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and    to test your program as you develop it.In the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards. A second phase of the course, to be offered later,  will consist of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This    will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem    domain interests you.','This course is about learning to program well: building programs that are elegant, well tested and easy to maintain.

Niçin türev ve entegral? Yaşamın iki önemli göstergesi değişim vebirikimdir. Değişim farklarla ve birikim de toplamalarla tanımlanır.

İstenen anlık değişiklik ve birikim sonsuzküçüklerin sıfır olduğu limitte ulaşılan değerlerdir. Limit diferansiyelhesabın dayandığı temel kavramdır.Bir fonksiyon, bir girdi (bağımsız değişken) ile çıktı (bağımlı değişken)arasındaki ilişkidir. Bağımlı değişkendeki değişimin, bağımsız değişkendekideğişime oranı “türev” kavramını getirir. Birikim de, örneğin kütleyi, elektrikyükünü, enerjiyi, uzunluğu, alanı, hacmi veren fonksiyonların bağımsızdeğişkendeki sonsuz küçük değerlerle ağırlıklı toplamıdır. Bu işlem “entegral”kavramıdır. İlkokuldan beri toplama ve çıkarmanın birbirinin tersi vetamamlayıcısı olduğunu biliyor ve kullanıyoruz. Bu ilişki türev ve entegraldede geçerlidir. Diferansiyel hesabın iki “temel teoremi” bu ilişkiyi kanıtlar:Bir fonksiyonun türevinin entegrali, başlangıçtaki fonksiyonu verir. Benzerolarak, bir fonksiyonun entegralinin türevi de başlangıçtaki fonksiyonu verir.Bu temel sonuçlar “Tek değişkenli fonksiyonların diferansiyel hesabı” dersindenbiliniyor. Bu ders aynı konuları temel alarak, kavram ve hesaplama yöntemleriniçok değişkenli fonksiyonlara geliştiriyor. Niçin çok değişkenli fonksiyonlar?

It develops the fundamental concepts of derivatives and integrals offunctions of several variables, and the basic tools for doing the relevantcalculations. The course is designed with a “content-based” approach, i. e. bysolving examples, as many as possible from real life situations. The “why” and“where“ of the topics are discussed, as much as the “what” and the “how”. Theanswers to the latter are the “definitions” and “proofs”, while the answers tothe first two tell the reason for studying a topic, and the areas where suchideas are used.The transfer of knowledge through an organized deductive process plays animportant role in mathematics (Aristotelian approach). An interactivecommunication between the teacher and the student through posing questions andanswering them leads to an effective method (Socratian method). The design of thiscourse will benefit from the latter whenever feasible.Why do we study derivatives and integrals? Because derivatives expresschange, and integrals define the cumulative results of many inputs. Change andgrowth through time or space are two basic aspects of life. Change is expressedwith the difference between two situations, and the cumulative result of manyinputs is an additive process. Thus basically, calculus is an extension of whatwe all learn as early as first grade as addition and subtraction. Calculusenables us to define and calculate instantaneous changes and growth bycontinuously varying inputs. Instantaneity of the changes and variability ofthe inputs are handled by infinitesimal quantities. The final results areobtained in the limit where the infinitesimal changes become zero. The limit isthe central concept of calculus.A function defines the relationship between the inputs, which are theindependent variables, and outputs which are the dependent variables. The ratioof the infinitesimal changes in the dependent variable to those of theindependent variable leads to the concept of the “derivative”. Similarly, thecumulative outputs of entities such as matter, energy, area, surface, volume,etc. are calculated by the sum of the dependent variable weighted by thechanges in the independent variable. This operation leads to the concept of“integral”. Just like in Grade One, where we observed that addition andsubtraction are the inverses of each other, so are integral and derivative. Thiscomplementarity between the derivative and integral is expressed by the two“fundamental theorems of calculus”. All this is studied in the “Calculus ofSingle Variable Functions”.Why multivariables? Because real life problems involve several variables.Our environment is defined by three space variables and phenomena evolve interms of a fourth which is time. People- made phenomena require many morevariables. The course offered here is built on the knowledge of calculus ofsingle variable functions and extends the concepts and techniques tomultivariable functions. The concepts and techniques are, in most cases,natural extensions and generalizations from those in single variable functions.Hence, each topic will start the review of the fundamental concepts andcalculation techniques from the calculus of one variable functions. This reviewis an opportunity to supplement what a student missed in the earlier course onsingle variables, while advancing into relevant problems from real life thatinvolve more than one variable.(Source: Attila Aşkar,Calculus of Multivariable Functions, Volume 2 of the set of Vol1: Calculus ofSingle Variable Functions, Volume 3: Linear Algebra and Volume 4: DifferentialEquations.

VisionSeeing:from the brain’s molecular light switches to a world in depthThis unit explains what light is,and how it is detected by photoreceptors in the eye.  It includes a history of vision researchdating back to ancient Greece, and describes the role of the astronomer Keplerin deducing how the image of the visual scene is formed on the eye.  How the two-dimensional projection of thevisual scene onto the surface of the retina is interpreted by the brain as athree-dimensional world is explored through examples from various artists suchas Magritte and Escher.2. SomatosensoryBody     sense:  Measuring and mismeasuring     your own shape, and why negative numbers are hard (for your brain)This unit covers how we know aboutthe positions of the parts of our bodies. Some intriguing illusions of body position sense are covered.  The combination of body position sense andour sense of touch yields a sense of the three-dimensional location and shapeof solid objects. 3. Brain mapsBrain     maps and polka dotsThis unit introduces the brainmechanisms responsible for sensory processing of vision and touch, with anemphasis on the formation of sensory maps in the visual and somatosensorypathways of the brain.  The implicationsof these maps and other neural response properties for perception of spatiallocation are explored, with an emphasis on object motion and contours.  Experiments using electrical stimulation insensory maps to probe their connection to perception are discussed.  4. AuditorySherlock     ear: how your brain finds soundsThis unit turns to a sensorysystem for which spatial location must be inferred from indirectmeasurements.  For vision and touch, thesensory receptors are able to measure spatial location in kind:  objects at different locations activateddifferent sensory receptors.  For hearing,the brain must compare and contrast the sounds arriving at each ear to makeinferences about the location of origin. This unit discusses the how this works, from the nature of sound itselfto the interpretation of location-dependent sound attributes by the brain.5. Brain meters for spaceMoving     with maps and metersThis unit introduces the conceptof a “meter” for spatial signals in the brain. More commonly but somewhat obscurely referred to as rate coding, thiskind of representation involves neural response rates that scale in proportionto spatial location – a meter whose level indicates position. This kind of codeis used in movements, the sense of body position, and in the early stages ofthe auditory pathway.  6. Reference framesDefining     space: reference framesSpatial locations are measuredwith respect to reference positions, but these reference positions differdepending on the type of sensory input. The eyes measure locations with respect to the eyes, and the earsmeasure locations with respect to the ears. This unit discusses some illusions related to this issue and describesbrain mechanisms for translating between different reference frames.  Synthesizing a sense of space across time asthe body and its sense organs move through the environment requires integratingmemories of the sensory input at different times and positions.7. Navigation  Going     places: Balance, flow, steps and shortcutsThis unit shifts focus in twoways:  (a) it involves space on a largerscale such as traveling from one place to another, and (b) it involves a senseof one’s own position in the environment as opposed to the position of objectsor events in that scene.  The role of thesense of balance and one’s own movements are incorporated.  Animal species that navigate long distancesand how they do this are described. 8. Space and memoryHow the brain\'s spatial systems provide a framework for remembering, and vice versaThis unit builds the first ofseveral important links between the sense of space and other kinds ofcognition.  Memory is closely linked tospatial processing at several levels. This unit discusses the role of the hippocampus in both navigation andmemory, and tells the story of patient HM, whose hippocampus was surgicallydestroyed in the 1950’s, resulting in lifelong amnesia.9. Thinking spatiallyHow the brain\'s spatial systems provide a framework for thinkingThis unit argues that thespace-sensitive regions of the brain do much more than evaluate location.  Instead, these areas are recruited forcognitive processes such as paying attention, making decisions, and planningfuture actions.  The kinds of computationsthat the brain performs on spatial inputs may resemble the kinds ofcomputations that the brain performs on abstract concepts and ideas.  Thinking about space and more general kindsof thinking may involve similar brain mechanisms.','Knowing where things are is effortless.  But “under the hood,” your brain devotes a tremendous amount of computational power to figuring out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.The material in this course overlaps with that normally covered in classes on perception or systems neuroscience.','This course is about how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.','4-5 hours/week','None','There are no prerequisites required.  ','null','null'),(103,'1194','Paradoxes of War','https://www.coursera.org/course/warparadoxes','https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/86/c3f28ee9c08bdeec5c2c986b778a9b/paradoxes-logo.png','princeton','socsci','en','The Warrior\'s WarIs War Natural?Warriors in BattleWhy Not Run Away?What Do Soldiers Believe In?BrutalityDisciplineFrom Wars of Armies to Wars of SocietiesWars of ArmiesProgress of Battle Gunpowder Industrialization of WarTechnowar War and SocietySocial Aspects of WarStatesNationalismSoldiers and CitizensWar and EqualityConquest.

Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues.

That’s why, in our view, character development and contentmastery act as the two complementary halves of remarkable teaching. Butthey’re often perceived to be in competition. When you ask parents abouttheir goals for their children, they almost always respond with terms like,“successful,” “happy,”“curious,” and “being kind to others.” But when you ask schoolsabout their goals, they often reply in terms of academic content, like “algebra,” “subject-verbagreement,” and “the periodic table.” Great teachers have always united those two visions.This course explores the interconnection between character research, education,and academic rigor.

And what can we learn from the study of those who seemingly    lack normal moral feelings, such as violent psychopaths?Week 3: Origins of Morality    Here, we ask about which aspects of morality are universal. We discuss    evolution, cross-cultural research, and the fascinating new    science of the moral life of babies.Week 4: Differences How does culture influence our moral thought and moral action? What role does religion play? Why are some of us conservative and others liberal, and how do political differences influence our sense of right and wrong?Week 5: Family, friends, and strangers     Our moral feelings are usually most powerful towards our kin (such as    our parents and our children) and our friends and allies. We will discuss    these special bonds, and then turn to the morality of racial and ethnic bias. Then we use the tools of behavioral economics to explore    the controversial question of whether we are ever truly altruistic to strangers.Week 6: The Big Answers      We’ll discuss some clever studies that show how our moral behavior is    powerfully influenced—often at the unconscious level—by the situations    that we find ourselves in. Such findings raise some hard problems about    determinism, free will, and moral responsibility. Most of all, if our actions    are determined by our brains, our genes, and our situations, in what sense    can we be said to be moral agents?

Evaluate the claim that sustainability in practice is about using design thinking to understand and manipulate systems.','Sustainability is defining a generation of students and young professionals and their influence is transforming things like cities, companies, and laws around the world. Sustainability is often explained as meeting “the needs of the present without compromising    the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” In practice, this means understanding connections, including connections across time. These connections create systems that are greater than the simple sums of their parts, with consequences    that are often unexpected by people paying attention to only one part of a system. This course provides an introduction to the ideas and practices that people are using to understand and change these connections in pursuing more sustainable processes,    communities, environments, and organizations. Systems theory appears in many guises and most disciplines claim some share of the systems approach to connections and consequences. In ways that we will explore in the course, design thinking is a method for putting systems theory into practice. Designers    and their way of thinking provide a significant contribution to sustainability in practice, from improving energy performance in buildings to identifying the value ecosystems services provide to human settlements. This course has several strategic    partners providing us with content and with platforms for discussion. These networks will provide the course with an extensive and diverse portfolio of problems, solutions, illustrations, and challenges with which to explore the ideas presented above.    We will use these very different venues as platforms for discussion and will organize student conversations and assignments using the network partners.     ','Sustainability is a practice operating across a variety of scales and skills.

Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available.

Develop Classroom Management AutomaticityCertain skills that delay a novice are automatic for an expert. Dribbling a basketball. Driving a car. Addressing classroom misbehavior is similarly difficult for a novice and effortless for an expert. At one moment the novice teacher might let a particular misbehavior slide entirely; at another they might respond too harshly; and at yet another they might respond with halting uncertainty. In this part of our course, we’ll cover concrete techniques and exercises that can help a rookie teacher develop the classroom management automaticity of an expert. 2. Practice Good Ratio Teachers love the spotlight. Often, a natural taste for being the center of attention might have drawn somebody to teaching in the first place. But we’ve concluded that there’s an inverse relationship between a teacher’s talking and his/her students’ learning: the more you talk, the less they learn. Doug Lemov from Uncommon Schools first coined the term “Ratio:” the amount of teacher work in a lesson compared to the amount of student work. Rookie teachers tend to have very bad Ratio because they often spend more energy thinking about their lessons in terms of what they want to say rather than what they want their students to do. In this part of our course, we’ll address when and how to use specific techniques such as “Turn and Talks” and “Stop and Jots” and “Student-to-Student Interactions” to get students to do more of the intellectual heavy-lifting in lessons. 3. Call ParentsMany preparation programs counsel new teachers to build positive relationships with parents, but few show them exactly how to approach that work. Lacking those details, it’s no surprise that rookie teachers quickly become overwhelmed by all of the aspects of their job that seem more pressing and urgent. “Sure it would be nice to have better relationships with parents, but it certainly doesn’t feel like a priority, when I’m drowning in papers to grade, lessons to plan and a messy class to organize!” We understand that sentiment, but we believe a teacher should view his/her investment of time in building relationships with parents as a key strategy for motivating students to give more effort in class. In this part of the course, we will very precisely show teachers how much time to spend phoning parents, what to say, and how to say it. ','Frustration. Hard Knocks. Sleepless nights. Tears.Those are just a few of the ways that rookie teachers describe their firstyear in the profession. And those sentiments have been validated by countlessresearch studies that show that students, on average, learn significantlyless when they’re taught by rookies. Unfortunately, many educators believethis is a necessary “rite of passage” – a sort of hazing that one mustexperience on their path to effective teaching.We don’t believe that.Over the past 6 years, the Match Teacher Residency has developed and refinedan approach to specifically address the challenges that are unique to therookie teacher experience. In this four-week course, we’ll explore thethree ideas that we\'ve found to contribute radically to success as a rookieteacher.“It\'s been a fantastic learning experience. I\'ve taken several Coursera courses and this one is definitely the most original and creative in its approach. I suppose its main advantage is the straightforwardness of teaching, clarity and impressive visual representation. Really looking forward to Part II, where rookie teachers may grow and develop their initial knowledge even further.”“This was my first Coursera course and it wasreally helpful, although I am a 12th year teacher.

Together we will explore this content while developing another really cool project to share. Participants who pass this track after also passing the Android Developer Track will earn a separate Illinois badge in addition to (but distinct from) their Statement of Accomplishment or Verified Certificate.The course is comprised of the following elements:Lecture videos. Each week your instructor, Lawrence Angrave, will teach you the concepts you need to know through a collection of short video lectures. The lectures include recordings of his computer screen that will guide you step-by-step through each of the main tasks you will complete in the course. You may either stream these videos for playback within the browser by clicking on their titles, or you can download each video for later offline playback by clicking the download icon.In-lecture questions. Each lecture has questions associated with it to help verify your understanding of the topics. These questions will automatically appear while watching the video if you stream the video through your browser. The questions are available as a separate downloadable text file for those who prefer to download the videos. These questions do not contribute toward your final score in the class.Quizzes. Each week will include 1 for-credit quiz. You will be allowed 5 attempts at the quiz. Each attempt may present a different selection of questions to you. Your highest score will be used when calculating your final score in the class. There is no time limit on how long you take to complete each attempt at the quiz. There is a deadline for each quiz; however, if you submit a quiz within the first 7 days after the deadline, you can still earn up to 85% of the possible points for the quiz.Projects. There are multiple projects in this course—2 during the required Android Developer Track and 1 during the optional Computer Science and Programming Track. In these projects, you will create your own apps and share them with the class. Your peers will then evaluate how well your project meets the requirements and provide you with feedback. At the same time, you will review the apps others have made, providing them with feedback while being exposed to a common practice in the industry: peer review.

We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions.  We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender.  We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives.

Scandinaviahas a strong film and television culture with institutions and traditionscreated to secure creative diversity for both national, Scandinavian and globalaudiences. In many ways Scandinavian film and television is a global culturalbrand, connected with and exporting some of the cultural and social valuesconnected to a liberal and progressive welfare society. Dating back to thesilent cinema era and through the birth of a modern film and television cultureafter 1945 Scandinavia has contributed significantly to our global culturalheritage. This course in Scandinavian Film and Television deals with the social,institutional and cultural background of film and television in Scandinavia andin a broader European and global context. The course will offer a deeperunderstanding of the creative forces behind film and television, of howScandinavian society and culture has influenced the production. The course willdeal with the co-production in Scandinavia and the role of Scandinavian filmand television internationally. Theoretically the course will deal withnational and global cinema, with film and media sociology, with genre andauteur theory and with film and media policy.The course will also deal with some of themost important film directors and film and television genres and the way theyhave reflected and influenced our understanding of Scandinavia and the image ofScandinavian culture and society abroad. From Carl Th. Dreyer’s complexhistorical and religious dramas, Ingmar Bergman’s symbolic and psychologicalfilms to the modern cinema of Lars von Trier, Aki Kaurismäki, Lukas Moodysonand Bent Hamer - all important Scandinavian names in a broader European artcinema tradition.  The course will dealwith typical examples of other and more popular genres in Scandinavian cinemaand modern, Scandinavian television drama and with aspects of the Scandinaviandocumentary tradition. Examples include Jan Troell’s epic serial The Immigrants/The New Land (1971-72), global,prize winning drama series like TheKilling (2007-12) and Borgen (2010-)and international film blockbusters such as the Stieg Larson trilogy.','In many ways Scandinavian film and television is a global cultural brand, connected with and exporting some of the cultural and social values connected to a liberal and progressive welfare society.

The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.Three features of the new system are central.Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That\'s the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.','Introduction to a “money view” of economic activity for modern times, building on the intellectual traditions of British central banking and American institutionalism.

However, this abstract thinking also reveals the great mystery of the Universe and demonstrates fundamentally why mathematics is both charming and irreplaceable. Unfortunately, it makes too many students afraid of mathematics and causes trouble for the study of mathematics. 本课程针对这一情况，试图和学生一起从思想上重走一遍前辈们走过的路，作一次轻松的数学之旅。在这一旅途中我们不断揭示一些概念和数学思想形成的过程和历史，理解数学抽象的必要性和魅力，真实体会数学抽象所表现出的人类心智的荣耀，潜移默化地从中培养数学抽象的能力。并试图就一些简单的数学例子介绍数学抽象的一些特点，并试图就学习数学时，如何克服抽象带来的困难谈一些看法。主讲人有信心使这门课程成为一次轻松的“抽象”旅游。并希望对学生的数学课程的学习和数学思维的形成，在心理和心智上都有所帮助。In this course, I try to walk along its history together with students to create a relaxed tour of mathematical concepts and thinking. This course will share the history and process of the formation of some mathematical concepts and philosophy, help students to understand the need for abstraction in mathematics, and teach students how to enjoy what is behind these abstract concepts so that they may handle them more confidently. We also try to show certain features of abstraction in mathematics through some simple examples that will teach students how to overcome common difficulties. I am confident this course will be enjoyable and helpful for those studying mathematics and the formation of mathematical thinking.好的旅游不是旅游点的累积，而是心与自然、心与心的交流。我们的“数学之旅”不期待你知道了多少数学概念，而期待你开始对数学的抽象有了体会，意识到数学的抽象其实不“抽象”，感受到数学思维所表现出的人类心智的荣耀。In this journey, the important thing is the interaction between heart and nature and heart and heart, instead of the number of viewpoints.

They also learn that the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere 2.5 billion years ago produced massive extinctions of life on Earth that forever altered the dominant types of single-celled life.  Students are exposed to how new scientific discoveries are made through the observations that led to plate tectonics, how the Moon formed, and why dinosaurs went extinct.','Develop a greater appreciation for how the air, water, land, and life formed and have interacted over the last 4.5 billion years.','5-8 hours/week','None','There is no recommended background content.  The course is open to anyone.  ','null','null'),(188,'1136','Документы и презентации в LaTeX (Introduction to LaTeX)','https://www.coursera.org/course/latex','https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/59/61b6b4924569d104a975c168fe88df/Introduction-to-LaTeX.jpg','hse','infotech','ru','Первая неделяВведение.

Лучшие математические, физические и экономические журналы издаются в LaTeX и рекомендуют авторам использовать его для подготовки рукописей. LaTeX не очень прост в освоении, но обладает массой преимуществ перед популярными текстовыми процессорами и редакторами презентаций:высококачественная верстка — текст выглядит «как в книжке»;удобная работа со сложными математическими формулами;отличная кросс-платформенная совместимость;автоматизация многих рутинных процессов: нумерации формул, рисунков, таблиц, разделов документа, перекрестных ссылок, создания колонтитулов, оформления стилей заголовков и т. п.;огромное сообщество пользователей и разработчиков, пакеты-расширения на все случаи жизни.LaTeX облегчает жизнь всем, кому приходится оформлять эссе, рефераты, курсовые и дипломные работы, диссертации, а также слайды презентаций на их основе. Пользователи, освоившие LaTeX, вспоминают верстку сложных документов в Word и создание больших презентаций в PowerPoint как страшный сон.Если вы сомневаетесь, стоит ли вам изучать LaTeX, почитайте более подробно о его преимуществах (по-английски):http://www.ctan.org/tex/http://www.andy-roberts.net/writing/latex/benefitshttp://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.htmlhttp://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb22-1-2/tb70heff.pdfУ курса есть официальная группа в социальной сети «ВКонтакте»: https://vk.com/hse.latex.LaTeX is the standard in the scientific world. The best mathematical, physical and economic journals are published in LaTeX and authors are encouraged to use it for manuscripts. LaTeX is quite difficult to learn, but it has many advantages over the most popular word processors and presentation software:high-quality typography – text looks as it would in a well published book;easy to typeset with complex mathematical formulas;excellent cross-platform compatibility;automation of many routine processes, i.e. to number formulas, figures, tables, document sections, to create cross references, headers, footers and design styles, etc.;a worldwide community of users and developers; extension packages for any occasion.LaTeX is an excellent tool for everyone who is going to draw up an essay, term paper, thesis or dissertation, as well as the presentation slides based upon them. Users who have learned LaTeX, can not ever conceive that they were once creating complex documents in Word or presentations in PowerPoint.If you are in doubt about whether you need to learn LaTeX or not, feel free to read more about its benefits (in English):http://www.ctan.org/tex/http://www.andy-roberts.net/writing/latex/benefitshttp://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.htmlhttp://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb22-1-2/tb70heff.pdfThis course offers a special page at the «VKontakte» social network (in Russian): https://vk.com/hse.latex.','LaTeX (читается «латех») — научная издательская система.

In some countries the unemployment rates of graduates exceeds 50%. The new skills - often erroneously called soft skills - are not being developed in schools or universities and in many cases when they are, there is uncertainty regarding how to assess and teach them.In times of great change, when uncertainties dominate thinking about education and work, the result is often a paralysis in education and a reversion to rudimentary approaches to assessment that fail to inform directed learning and teaching.

ABOUT THE COURSE    Not too long ago, it was believed that anyone who graduated from a doctoral program was capable of teaching. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that teaching is not an intuitive behavior. In addition to content, teaching also involves a    complex intellectual process, and to develop the “art” of teaching, professors require guidance and support. As the roles and responsibilities of university-level educators have evolved and expanded in recent years, the preparation of emerging university    faculty leaders must focus on the development of the knowledge, skills, and strategies for teaching and learning in higher education. This short course is designed to introduce the strategies and exemplars of university teaching skills necessary to    meet these new professional demands for teaching at a university level.  ','Higher education professionals, new PhD graduates, newly hired university educators and research scientists, and others interested in enhancing their teaching techniques in a university setting will acquire in this six-week course the foundational knowledge of the science of teaching and learning and develop skills and strategies for teaching at the university level.

This week willinclude an overview of the areas and dimensions of the Teaching throughInteractions Framework. For this course, we’ll focus specifically on the areaof Emotional Support. Week Two – Building Positive Relationshipswith Children – The dimension of Positive Climate: This week will focus on thefirst dimension of Emotional Support – Positive Climate. You’ll learn about theimportance of Positive Climate, see examples of real teachers as theydemonstrate effective Positive Climate interactions with their students, and geta chance to analyze what you’re seeing. There will also be an optional homeworkassignment in which you will videotape your own teaching interactions withchildren and then analyze what you see based on what you have learned aboutPositive Climate. Week Three – Providing Individualized Supportto Young Children – The dimension of Teacher Sensitivity: This week will focus on the nextdimension of Emotional Support – Teacher Sensitivity. You’ll learn about theimportance of sensitive interactions with children and what sensitiveinteractions look like in real classrooms. You’ll have the opportunity toanalyze classroom videos based on what you know about Teacher Sensitivity.Again, there will be an optional homework assignment in which you willvideotape your own teaching and analyze your interactions looking specificallyat the dimension of Teacher Sensitivity. Week Four – Supporting Children’sIndependence and Sense of Self – The dimension of Regard for Child Perspectives: In the final week, you’ll learn about the last Emotional Support dimension –Regard for Child Perspectives. You’ll learn how important it is for youngchildren to have opportunities for their voices and perspectives to be heard,as well as how to foster children’s feelings of self-efficacy and positiveself-concepts through your daily interactions. In addition to opportunities toview and analyze classroom interactions based on your knowledge of Regard forChild Perspectives, you’ll have an optional homework assignment allowing you to dothe same thing with videotape of your own classroom interactions. Finally,we’ll sum up all that you have learned about all of the dimensions of EmotionalSupport across the course.','When we look at the research about what teachers actually do each day    that makes a difference in children’s lives, there’s clear evidence that    it’s the daily interactions that teachers have with children that are most    important.  And we know quite a bit about the specific type of interactions    that lead to children’s development and learning.  So this course    focuses on those interactions.  By the end of the course, you should    have a deep knowledge and understanding of the types of interactions that    foster learning and development among your students. Although there are many types of interactions that are critical toyoung children’s development, this course will focus on one area in particular– Emotional Support. This course focuses on Emotional Support because it is really thefoundation of every early childhood classroom. In classrooms that areEmotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another andexcited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and knowthat, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.What do you need to know to be a really effective early childhood    teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge – knowledge about children’s    development, about the content they’re teaching, about effective teaching    practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms,    and about themselves. In this course we’ll focus a bit on knowledge about    children’s development and we’ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge    about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and    development.Another part of effective teaching is seeing. All the knowledge    in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good    teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like – in lots of different    types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers    tell us they don’t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers    teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get    them. We’ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom    videos and we’ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.Ultimately we can’t learn to be an effective teacher without practice    – we need to spend some time doing – enacting the teaching practices    that we’ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really    learn about them – you need to spend some time practicing the types of    interactions we’ll be talking about.There’s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective     teachers spend time reflecting on their practice. We think of this    a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying    glass – we’ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have    learned throughout this course.Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget    Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom    Assessment Scoring System – or CLASS(™). CLASS is an observational measure    used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective    teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching    practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe    and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to    increase the effectiveness of teachers\' interactions with young children.       *********************************************************************   The development of the course was funded, in part, by theInstitute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through GrantR305A100154-11 to the University of Virginia. The opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not representviews of the U.S. Department of Education. ','During the early childhood years children gain knowledge and skills that provide the foundation for later learning. Young children learn many of these skills through the interactions they have with their teachers.

Scholars estimatethat teachers have over 1000 unique exchanges with students every day, most ofwhich are unplanned and require quick decision making. And then there are themyriad daily decision points related to curriculum planning, assessing studentwork, and interactions with parents and colleagues. Amidst this frenzy, it’seasy for “bad” habits to set in, and hard to break them once they do.The question then becomes: How in such a fast-paced environment can coachesand instructional leaders help teachers execute changes in their practice thatactually stick?  Effective teacher-coaches are not just knowledgeable aboutinstruction; they’re also highly strategic in their approach to changingteachers’ behaviors. That starts with preparing teachers to receive criticalfeedback, and then continues with a careful selection of goals and scaffolds toensure that feedback is implemented with fidelity. Oftentimes, teacher coaching suffers from a lack ofdirection, a lack of support, or both. The coach might tell the teacher to “DoX,” but then fail to articulate clear, measurable steps forimplementation.  Most commonly, coachescan be overly suggestive, telling the teacher “You might do X, Y, and Z,and maybe even A, B, and C, too.” With an already very full plate, thisapproach leaves the teacher uncertain of what to focus on first, undercuttingthe likelihood of meaningful change. Even teacher coaching that’s described as “good” can sometimesfall short of resulting in meaningful change. The coach might see and say theright things, and the teacher might be very appreciative of the feedback. Butunless the coaching drives true changes in behavior, the “good” in this casecould actually end up being the enemy of effective. Match Education trains and employs dozens of coaches whoprovide intensive support for teachers in Boston and New Orleans. Courseparticipants will be introduced to Match’s Five key principles of effectivecoaching, which strike the right balance between providing clear direction forteachers, while giving them the support they need to achieve their goals: 1)    Permission-basedCoachingTeachers first need to permit themselves to receivecoaching in order for meaningful change to occur. A skillful coach needs toknow how to ask for and create buy-in for this level of permission. In thissession of the course, we focus on concrete strategies that help teachersreceive and process critical feedback, while maintaining a “growth mindset”about their practice. 2)    SharedVocabulary and VisionA teacher coaching relationship must begin with a sharedvocabulary for talking about instruction, and a common vision for whatexcellent teaching looks like. In this session of the course, we introduce asimple observation rubric and several video exercises that a coach could usewith a teacher to communicate the parameters of what s/he will be looking forwhen s/he conducts classroom observations.3)    Selectingand Setting Measurable Goals Novice teachers, in particular, often describe the feedbackthey receive from expert coaches as akin to “drinking from a fire hose” –there’s so much to work on that it becomes difficult to identify and prioritizenext steps for their practice. In this session of the course, we focus on howto analyze classroom instruction and select a single, measurable goal thataddresses a particularly high leverage aspect of a teacher’s practice. 4)    DeliveringDirective FeedbackWe believe that teachers need to leave a coaching feedbacksession with absolute clarity about the steps they should take to achieve theirgoals. However, the clarity of those steps could easily be obscured by a coachwho struggles to deliver candid feedback or to help the teacher articulateconcrete, actionable solutions. In this session, we introduce and practice aprotocol for debriefing a classroom observation that ensures that teachers havethe direction they need to successfully implement a coach’s feedback. 5)    CreateOpportunities for Practice Great coaches don’t just leave it to chance that a teacheris ready to implement feedback after merely discussing what to do. They firsttry to create opportunities for the teacher to rehearse or apply the actionsteps in the presence of the coach before the teacher attempts to do it in theclassroom. In this session, we explore different exercises for practicingaction steps within a coaching feedback session. Course Learning Outcomeso  Todescribe and analyze strategies that help a teacher develop a growth mindsetabout accepting and acting on critical feedback.o  Todescribe and analyze tools (e.g. observation rubrics) that help teachers andcoaches develop a shared vocabulary and vision about excellent classroompractice. o  Toderive clear and measurable improvement goals for teachers based onobservations of their practice. o  Todescribe and analyze protocols for delivering directive, actionable feedback toteachers. o  Todescribe and analyze exercises that generate meaningful opportunities topractice implementing feedback. ','Learn and practice strategies for coaching teachers to make meaningful, long-lasting improvements in their instruction.

Macroeconomicsis a word derived from the Greek prefix “makros”, meaning large. It is the studyof economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of theeconomic management role played by governments and international organisations.The founder ofmodern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote“The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are rightand when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to bequite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of somedefunct economist.” This will be the key theme we explore in the course, theinfluence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,unemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.We will coverimportant macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemploymentand inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laidthe foundation for governments’ active management of the macroeconomy in thepost war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscalpolicy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.  Economists’ approaches to the analysis oflong run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will becritical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debateand disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will notshy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematictheorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approachtheir task.

At the start of the course all of the assignments and lectures are available and each student is free to design their own plan of study and proceed at their own pace.  The assessments in the course consist of five programming assignments and one extra credit assignment.  In the programming assignments, students experience the challenges of real world optimization problems such as selecting the most profitable locations of retail stores (warehouse location) and the design of package delivery routes (vehicle routing).  The class community is an important aspect of this course and students are encouraged to collaborate and help each other in the completion of the assignments.','Optimization technology is ubiquitous in our society.

In fact, Gregory Higby of the American Institute    of the History of Pharmacy has written that, “...the very concept    of influencing bodily functions via an outside force must be considered    one of humanity’s greatest advances.” Since its independent origins    in ancient Arabic civilizations, pharmacy has evolved from a craft dedicated    to the compounding of drugs to a profession focusing on helping patients    get the best outcomes from medication therapies.So what is pharmacy? How has it changed and where is it headed?This course will answer these questions and provide a comprehensive introduction    to this profession. We will explore the history of pharmacy and its evolving    scope of practice; examine educational and career pathways; tackle issues    relating to medication safety and adverse drug events; gain insight into    the regulatory and ethical considerations in pharmacy practice; and more.As we explore these topics together, we will hear from practicing pharmacists    throughout the course and ultimately gain a better understanding of what    they do and how they help us get the best results from our medications.    Maybe you will decide that the dynamic profession of pharmacy is a career    path that you want to pursue!  Whether student or healthcare consumer,    you’re sure to find the material we cover in this course to be invaluable.','This course is a survey of the profession of pharmacy including its history, evolving scope of practice, ethical foundations, regulation, educational and career opportunities, and more.

Week 1: Observed Climate Changes and Impacts: Hundreds of Thousands of Years to Now        This module outlines the historical observed changes in the climate system leading up to the present day and the impacts that can now be attributed to human-induced climate change. It examines the rise of greenhouse gas emissions since preindustrial times, while explaining the link between CO2 concentrations and the rising global mean temperature, ocean heat storage and sea-level rise, as well as uncertainties in the scientific evidence. It also describes the trends of increasing loss of ice in Greenland and Antarctica, increasing loss of Arctic sea ice, melting mountain glaciers, increased heat waves and extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity trends.            Week 2: Possible 21st Century Climates        This module provides an overview of the projected changes in climate leading up to the end of the 21st century. It describes the likelihood of a 4°C warmer world by 2100 AD and enables a deeper understanding of various climate models with different projections and key areas of uncertainty. It also reviews possible responses from natural systems, explaining how the projected climatic changes from 2°C to 4°C warming could result in sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification.            Week 3: Life in a 4°C Warmer World        a) Impacts Across Key Human Support Systems        This module presents an overview of current and projected climate impacts across key human support systems, such as agriculture and food production, water resources, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human health. Each of these human support systems will be negatively impacted by climate change under a 4°C warming scenario, resulting in adverse consequences for development, such as: diminishing crop yields, which threaten food production and human health; loss of biodiversity; the spread of vector-borne diseases; and water scarcity.            b) Risks of Large-Scale and Disruptive Changes in the Climate System        This module brings together information from earlier modules, by considering how the impacts of, risks from and vulnerabilities to climate change may scale with increasing levels of CO2 concentrations and global mean warming. It highlights the risks of nonlinear and cascading impacts and the risk of crossing critical thresholds for nonlinear tipping elements of the Earth system, which could dramatically increase vulnerability to climate change and impose multiple stresses on development.            Week 4: What Can We Do About It? The Choice Is in Your Hands (Discussion)        After having outlined the scientific evidence in previous modules, this final module goes beyond the Turn Down the Heat report and provides a discussion on what mitigation and adaptation action is needed to help avoid a 4°C world, while also decreasing vulnerability to climate change impacts and building climate resilience. Since no single solution exists, this module will share perspectives from a range of actors on a range of key policy measures and climate actions. Track 1 (for the general public) will showcase how different lifestyles may affect changes in the climate and explore everyday choices that can help mitigate climate change and decrease vulnerability to its impacts. Track 2 (for policymakers) invites leaders from various countries, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and civil society to exchange ideas and examples of effective policies and actions that can help in the transition towards a low-emissions and climate-resilient development path.    Depending on your particular interest, you can choose to participate in one of two tracks as an optional activity.Track 1: Climate ChampionsTrack 2: Policy and Leadership           Track 1    Track 2             Target Audience     The ‘Climate Champions’ track is suitable for anyone with an interest in climate change, and provides more insight into the science behind climate change and opportunities to further expand your knowledge of key areas.    The ‘Policy and Leadership’ track involves connecting with others in similar positions (e.g., policymakers, provincial and national government personnel, representatives of civil society, academia) around the world, and developing new networks of practice around climate change issues.        Common objective    To understand observed changes in the climate system, their causes and immediate consequences, and projected medium- to long-term impacts on development               Track-specific objectives          To describe the climate context under the current level of 0.8° warming and recognize how projected changes in climate (under 2°C to 4°C warming) could affect such sectors as agriculture, water resources, ecosystems and health    To realize how your lifestyle contributes to changes in the climate system and outline the actions you can take to reduce your climate impact or carbon footprint         To critically interpret different climate projections and recognize how these changes in climate (under 2°C to 4°C warming as opposed to a current warming level of 0.8°C) could affect such sectors as agriculture, water resources, ecosystems and human health    To discuss and distinguish between suitable policy options that countries/organizations need to take to help mitigate and adapt to climate change        Assignments          Assignments focus on facilitating a basic understanding of the science. You will learn how to apply the knowledge you have gained to your everyday lives.                Assignments focus mostly on policy intervention for sectors that need urgent climate action, and connecting with others in similar positions.You will be able to apply the knowledge you have gained to your specific country and policy context.

This MOOC brings together renowned scientists to provide a synthesis of the most recent scientific evidenceand presents an analysis of likely impacts and risks, with a focus on developing countries. It chronicles already observed changes in the climate system and their impacts, through the increase in carbon dioxide emissions, corresponding temperature increasesand melting of glaciers and sea ice, and changes in precipitation patterns. This course also offers projections for the 21st century for droughts, heat waves and sea-level rise, with implications for food and water security, as well as possible impactson agriculture, water availability, ecosystems and human health.This MOOC presents an analysis of the likely impacts of a 4°C warming trajectory and stresses the need for decision makers and communities to take a serious look at their adaptation choices, while also signaling the urgency for mitigation action. Participantswill also be introduced to the risks of triggering non-linearity, and tipping elements, such as the disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet and large-scale Amazon dieback. The course ends with a discussion of the main policy choices needed to preventwarming above 2°C.','It is now clear that without action on climate change, the world may become 4°C warmer by the end of this century.

You may be a budding entrepreneur working with a business partner in the proverbial start-up garage, or as chef with kitchen and serving staff in a three star restaurant. You may be part of a globally dispersed team of engineers collaborating virtually on a new aircraft, a member of an online community collectively compiling a web encyclopedia, or a volunteer involved with a network of development aid workers supporting a community hit by humanitarian crisis. The success of any organization we are engaged in – especially when it brings together individuals from across borders and cultures – ultimately depends on how well we understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors. All of us can contribute to improving the organizations we work in, and social science research can provide us with the tools to do so. Insights from psychologists, neuroscientists, sociologists and anthropologists, from communication scholars and from management scholars allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. In addition, social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders.Learning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?We are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and self-discovery. ','Learn to better understand and manage cognition, emotion and behavior of people in organizations across different cultural contexts.

It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important    ways.

As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we\'re excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.I hope you enjoy the course!Why Study Compilers?Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.','This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers.

I will ask you to draft and revise a critical response to an article about expertise by one of several different authors . You will draw on your selected area of expertise to respond to the author\'s arguments. Specifically, we will focus on how to:read critically;summarize, question, analyze, and evaluate written text;engage with the work of others;understand the stages of the writing process;workshop writing;respond towards revision;incorporate reader feedback;integrate quotes/evidence;cite the work of others; andcraft effective titles.Unit 2 (Weeks 4-5): Explicating a Visual ImageWhat does expertise look like? How do we define it? I will ask you to select a visual image depicting your selected area of expertise and then explicate that image in order to make an argument about what expertise looks like and how it can be defined. Specifically, we will continue to work with the elements we learned in Unit 1, as well as build on them by focusing on how to:summarize, questions, analyze, and evaluate visual texts;argue and support a position;use evidence;achieve cohesion;develop paragraph unity;revise; andeditUnit 3 (Weeks 6-9): Case StudyWhat can we learn about expertise in a particular area? What does it take to succeed? I will ask you to research a particular example of expert achievement in your selected area and, drawing on multiple resources, make an argument about expertise. Specifically, we will continue to work with the elements we learned in Units 1 and 2, as well as build on them by focusing on how to: conduct research;write an extended argument;examine disciplinary expectations;develop an intertextual conversation;understand popular sources and scholarly sources;create effective introductions; andwrite strong conclusions.Unit 4 (Weeks 10-12): Writing an Op-EdWhat do you think people need to know about expertise in your selected area? In this fourth and final unit, we will turn to a more public form of writing as I ask you to write an op-ed (opposite the editorial page) about your selected area of expertise for a publication of your choosing (you do not actually have to submit it to that publication). We\'ll also be working together to collaboratively crowdsource a bibliography of potential resources. Specifically, we will continue to work with the elements we learned in Units 1,2, and 3, as well as build on them by focusing on how to:write for publics;write concisely;edit and proofread thoroughly;decide whether to use active or passive verbs; andtransfer writing skills to new writing contexts.','English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundation for the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write effective arguments, understand the    writing process, and craft powerful prose that meets readers’ expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success?    Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical    review to an argument about expertise (600-800 words); an explication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words) and an Op-Ed (500-750 words). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop    structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback. Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:  1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These    skills are useful across virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well. Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration    or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with practice, dedication, and working with others, you can be an effective academic writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations.

Such connectedness can be not only emotional and erotic butalso political, environmental, and even textual, enacted through writing. Inthis course we explore the nature and meaning of such connections in ten major works of narrative fiction from the 18th century to thepresent. These include: Manon Lescaut by Abbé Prévost; two works by Herman Melville, Bartleby the Scrivener and Benito Cereno; Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre and two stories by FranzKafka, “Metamorphosis” and “The Country Doctor”;Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouseand William Faulkner’s Light in August;  an anthology of stories, Ficciones, by Jorge LuisBorges and The Ice Palace by TarjeiVesaas; Tony Morrison’s Beloved and Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee.As this course will demonstrate, the mostcritical relationships in our lives—the comings and goings that define us—arenot always easy to get a fix on, but literature offers us a special sighting onthese arrangements.

An appreciation    of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into    the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions.

У людей есть предпочтения относительно товаров и бюджетныеограничения, у фирм – производственные возможности и спрос на их продукцию состороны людей. В результате взаимодействия людей и фирм складываются рынки,на которых определяется цена – важнейший канал передачи информации.Чтобы информации было больше, существуют рынки, накоторых продаются и покупаются товары и услуги. Потребитель никогда не купитнужный ему товар, если не узнает, где и как его можно купить. Производитель нестанет его изготавливать, если не будет уверен, что найдется покупатель,который его приобретет. Каждый человек и каждая фирма обладает какими-тосведениями – прежде всего о себе самом, о своих вкусах, интересах, потребностяхи возможностях. Однако информации у всех становится во много раз больше, когдасубъекты начинают взаимодействовать – производят и потребляют, продают, покупаюти меняются. Поведение людей и фирм на рынках – основной предмет изучения вкурсе микроэкономики.The introductory course in Microeconomics describes the basic instruments of economic analysis, which allow us to study the most important patterns in the behavior of people and firms.

Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysisshould help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as representedby the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to thisview, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing andaugmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations.The term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals andmeans and more complex summaries: the principalcomponents of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities.Similarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations betweeninput and target features including Bayes classifiers.The view of the data as a subject ofcomputational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently.Typically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then theinvestigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards asolution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially withthe advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this dataset - what sense can be made out of it? – Is there any structure in the dataset? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to atraveler’s view of the world rather than that of a scientist. The scientistsits at his desk, gets reproducible signals from the universe and tries to accommodatethem into a great model of the universe. The traveler deals with what come ontheir way – here is the data analysis niche. A textbook by the instructor along these lines has been published bySpringer-London in 2011: “Coreconcepts in data analysis is clean and devoidof any fuzziness. The author presents his theses with a refreshing clarityseldom seen in a text of this sophistication. … To single out just one of thetext’s many successes: I doubt readers will ever encounter again such a detailedand excellent treatment of correlation concepts.

The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.Three features of the new system are central.Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That\'s the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.','Introduction to a “money view” of economic activity for modern times, building on the intellectual traditions of British central banking and American institutionalism.

Translation: how high-level languages are translated into the basic instructions        embodied in process hardware with a particular focus on C and Java.    Control flow: how computers organize the order of their computations,        keep track of where they are in large programs, and provide the illusion        of multiple processes executing in parallel.At the end of this course, students should:    understand the multi-step process by which a high-level program becomes        a stream of instructions executed by a processor;    know what a pointer is and how to use it in manipulating complex data        structures;    be facile enough with assembly programming (X86) to write simple pieces        of code and understand how it maps to high-level languages (and vice-versa);    understand the basic organization and parameters of memory hierarchy and        its importance for system performance;    be able to explain the role of an operating system;    know how Java fundamentally differs from C;    grasp what parallelism is and why it is important at the system level;        and    be more effective programmers (more efficient at finding bugs, improved        intuition about system performance).Topics:    Number representation    Assembly language    Basics of C    Memory management    Operating-system process model    High-level machine architecture    Memory hierarchy    Implementation of high-level languages','This course examines key computational abstraction levels below modernhigh-level languages; number representation, assembly language, introductionto C, memory management, the operating-system process model, high-levelmachine architecture including the memory hierarchy, and how high-levellanguages are implemented.

School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking. The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course.Subtitles for all video lectures available in: Portuguese (provided by The Lemann Foundation), English','Learn how to think the way mathematicians do - a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.','8-10 hours/week','Keith Devlin','High school mathematics. Specific requirements are familiarity with elementary symbolic algebra, the concept of a number system (in particular, the characteristics of, and distinctions between, the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers), and some elementary set theory (including inequalities and intervals of the real line). Students whose familiarity with these topics is somewhat rusty typically find that with a little extra effort they can pick up what is required along the way. The only heavy use of these topics is in the (optional) final two weeks of the Extended Course.A good way to assess if your basic school background is adequate (even if currently rusty) is to glance at the topics in the book Adding It Up: Helping Children Learn Mathematics (free download), published by the US National Academies Press in 2001. Though aimed at K-8 mathematics teachers and teacher educators, it provides an excellent coverage of what constitutes a good basic mathematics education for life in the Twenty-First Century (which was the National Academies\' aim in producing it).','null','null'),(283,'125','An Introduction to Operations Management','https://www.coursera.org/course/operations','https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6e/08f77596e49365212ef3d4ba78369e/coursera_operations_600.png','penn','business','en','The course is broken up into six modules:    Introduction    Process analysis    Productivity    Responsiveness    Quality    Product varietyThere are two tracks in this course, an academic track and a practitioner track.

What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and    didn’t want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctor’s office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with    great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didn’t want to pay too much for it.        Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity,    increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations,    Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels.

This proposalis followed by an overview of the scientific process because the research andtheory discussed in the class will consist of alternative perspectives and thestudents will learn how different perspectives are developed and evaluated.This process will enhance their critical thinking skills.Lecture 2: There have been two primary theoreticalframeworks to describe language and its acquisition. The nativist positionholds that language and its acquisition are uniquely dependent on a considerableamount of innate abilities, and unlike other perceptual and cognitivefunctions. The empiricist position holds that very little, if any, of languagedepends on innate abilities and its acquisition can be accounted for by typicalperceptual and cognitive processes. To evaluate these two theoreticalframeworks, we will learn about language structure, how it is used, and how itis acquired.Lectures 3 and 4: To set the stage for assessing thepossibility of naturally acquired reading, we will explore speech perceptionand how it is acquired. Speech has also had two alternative theoreticalframeworks, and we will consider relevant research that addresses theirdifferences. The goal of this assessment is to better understand what isrequired for speech perception and its acquisition and how these requirementscompare to the natural acquisition of reading.Lectures 5 and 6: These lectures will give an overview ofresearch and theory on reading and literacy. Given the possibility of naturallyacquired reading, we will review the nature of reading and how it is currentlytaught. One of the main goals is to destroy prevalent myths about how we read.This discussion will highlight the assumptions in current practice and how theycompare to the possibility of naturally acquired reading.Lecture 7: As covered in the previous lectures, it iscommonly believed that spoken and signed languages are acquired from birthonward by natural interactions with persons who talk whereas learning to readrequires formal instruction and schooling. We consider the hypothesis that oncean appropriate form of written text is made available early in a child’s lifebefore formal schooling begins, reading will also be learned inductively,emerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. We willexamine the role of perception and action modalities in language acquisitionand use and compare spoken and signed languages to written languages.Lecture 8: We will describe the demographics of literacy andilliteracy and their social and economic implications. The cost of illiteracyas well as the huge cost of formal literacy instruction is one of the majorfinancial burdens on societies.Lecture 9: We will study the implications of naturallyacquired literacy for individuals who are spoken and/or written languagechallenged because of deafness or other impairments.Lecture 10.

It is the enabler of any software, algorithm, or communication protocols. All the computation will eventually be carried out by hardware, namely the processor or the circuits.In this course, we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective. We will start with a short survey of the roles of hardware in security and trust. With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits, known as co-processors, being developed to speed up application specific computations, hardware’s role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays, hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However, current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently, we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems.  Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats. We conclude with the basic principles and practical methods of design for security and trust, as well as a study of the associated design cost.  Next, we introduce physical attacks to popular digital systems such as smart cards and FPGA-based systems. We will focus on side-channel attacks, which have been demonstrated many times to be able to successfully reveal the secret cryptographic keys stored in the secure systems. These attacks include power analysis, timing attacks, and electromagnetic attacks. Standard countermeasures to these attacks will also be introduced. Finally we will learn the new hardware security primitives that can help us to build secure systems. We will see how the trust platform module (TPM) works; what is a silicon physical unclonable function (PUF) and why it is useful for system security; what is a hardware Trojan horse and the security threats it brings to the system; why counterfeiting becomes a serious problem for hardware design intellectual property protection. Upon completing the course, students will understand the vulnerabilities in current digital system design flow and the physical attacks to these systems. They will learn that security starts from hardware design and be familiar with the tools and skills to build secure and trusted hardware.

Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.','In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques.','15-20 hours/week','Daphne Koller, Professor','','null','null'),(303,'368','The Beauty of Kunqu Opera | 崑曲之美','https://www.coursera.org/course/kunqu','https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9f/be4492ecd9aaba45923cd110066303/Version-A_2.jpg','cuhk','arts','zh-tw','單元一：歷史文化視野中的崑曲1. 崑曲演出簡史 (臺灣大學王安祈教授)2. 崑曲與明清歷史社會 (香港城巿大學鄭培凱教授)單元二：崑曲的音樂3. 崑腔音樂 (蘇州大學周秦教授)4. 崑唱藝術 (香港崑曲研究者張麗真女士)單元三：崑曲與古典文學5. 崑曲經典劇目 (香港中文大學華瑋教授)單元四：崑曲的表演藝術6. 崑曲表演（巾生）(上海崑劇團岳美緹女士)7. 崑曲表演（冠生、窮生） (上海崑劇團蔡正仁先生)8. 崑曲表演（閨門旦、正旦、老生）(江蘇省崑劇院張繼青女士、姚繼琨先生)9. 崑曲表演（貼旦、丑）(上海崑劇團梁谷音女士、劉異龍先生)10.崑曲表演（武生、淨）(北方崑曲劇院侯少奎先生)單元五：崑曲美學與現代世界11. 崑曲與傳統思想文化 (臺北藝術大學辛意雲教授)12.崑曲詩的意境：從平面到立體 (美國加州大學白先勇教授)*崑劇折子戲導賞 (美國加州大學白先勇教授)13.崑曲新美學：傳統與現代 (美國加州大學白先勇教授)14.課程總結：崑曲與現代世界 (香港中文大學華瑋教授)','本課程以崑曲的歷史文化背景、音樂、表演、文學、美學為核心主題，透過解說、欣賞、分析、討論，加深學生對中國傳統文化、古典文學與表演藝術之鑑賞能力。課程所選崑劇經典如《牡丹亭》和《長生殿》，學生除研讀其劇本選齣，並將在老師的導引下，觀賞、領會崑曲載歌載舞、寫意抒情的特點。學生透過本科的學習，可以 :(1) 增進對中國歷史及其文化瑰寶「崑曲」的認識(2) 加深對中國古典文學、美學與表演藝術之鑑賞能力(3) 加深對中國人文精神的感知(4) 增加學生文化素養，對個人及社會的感悟','本課程以崑曲的歷史文化背景、音樂、表演、文學、美學為核心主題，透過解說、欣賞、分析、討論，加深學生對中國傳統文化、古典文學與表演藝術之鑑賞能力。課程所選崑劇經典如《牡丹亭》和《長生殿》，學生除研讀其劇本選齣，並將在老師的導引下，觀賞、領會崑曲載歌載舞、寫意抒情的特點。','3-5 hours/week','Hsien-yung Kenneth Pai and Wei Hua','講學語言：普通話 / 繁體中文','null','null'),(304,'369','中國人文經典導讀 | Classics of Chinese Humanities: Guided Readings','https://www.coursera.org/course/chinesehumanities','https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a5/c14102371930437cc47e4107f14e0b/humanities.jpg','cuhk','humanities','zh-tw','1 第一講：「英雄本色」選讀《史記．項羽本紀》「鴻門宴」、「霸王別姬」相關段落，探究儒家思想哲學涵意，並論其如何影響中國哲學思想之發展。1.1 司馬遷和史記: “究天人之際，通古今之變，成一家之言”1.2 “項羽本紀”的史詩文字1.3 兩種英雄模式：“王”和“霸”1.4 歷史和演義—從史記到三國2 第二講：「政教道統」選讀唐朝古文大家韓愈之經典文章《原道》，此文第一次把儒家聖賢之道立為道統，以反駁道家和佛家所宣揚的道理，影響了後世各代的儒家知識分子。此文也是唐宋古文八大家的始創者的代表作，條理清晰，論證豐富，文氣波瀾起伏。我們將試圖用欣賞和批判的雙重角度來解讀。2.1 韓愈和唐宋八大家2.2 論辯儒家之“道”2.3 古文的形式和規範2.4 政統與道統3 第三講：「江河歲月」選讀蘇東坡之經典篇章〈赤壁賦〉，並論古典文學與山水畫之關係。3.1 中國文學中的抒情美學傳統3.2 蘇東坡的三種人生觀：儒，釋，道3.3 赤壁賦與歷史回憶 （兼談“念奴嬌--大江東去”）3.4 遊山玩水，詩情畫意4 第四講：「魂兮歸來」選讀魯迅之經典篇章〈阿Q 正傳〉，並論魯迅於現代文學及文化研究之意義。4.1 從傳統到現代：魯迅的文化意識4.2阿Q的造型和意義4.3從創作中招魂','本課程選取的四個主題是：英雄本色：以《史記》爲例，討論上古英雄傳統政教道統：以韓愈的兩篇古文爲例，討論儒家自孔孟以來的道統江河歲月：以蘇轼的前後《赤壁賦》爲例，討論中國美學的意境和大自然的關係 魂兮歸來：以魯迅最著名的兩篇小說 《狂人日記》 和《阿Q 正傳》為例，探討現代性和傳統的關係授課時采用古今中外的各種文本和材料（包括通俗媒體）作互文式的解讀，並兼及其他文本。學生將跟隨教師在精讀經典篇章之余，得以鑒賞中國古文、詩歌、繪畫、書法作品，學習如何把傳統文化和現代意識和感受連在一起。四個主題各有特色又互為映襯，為學生學習、鑒賞中國古典文化，開啟新的視野。','本課程是以四堂演講的方式，分別討論中國文化的四個主要面向，彙文學、歷史、哲學、藝術于一爐。每一個主題以一篇或兩篇經典文本爲基礎，指導學生如何精讀作品，學習以欣賞和批判的雙重角度重新解讀經典，同時獲得對中國文字的陶冶和享受。它本爲大學一年級學生所設，但不限於中文系本科專業，希能為學生鑒賞中國傳統文化開啟新的視野。','2-3 hours/week','Ou Fan Leo Lee and Wai Tsui','授課語言：普通話 / 繁體中文。必讀基礎讀本：錢穆，《從中國歷史來看中國民族性及中國文化》，香港：中文大學出 版社，2009。','null','null'),(305,'1509','Çok Değişkenli Fonksiyonlarda Türev ve Entegral II: İleri Konular ve Uygulamalar / Multivariable Calculus II: Applications and A','https://www.coursera.org/course/multivarii','https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/aa/238cb0ae7511e38cf97bde89f9f3a9/MultivarLogo250Finallogo1.png','koc','math','tr','Türkçe(Her derste çok sayıda çözümlü problem veöğrencilerin çözmesi için ödevler ile incelenen konulardaki temel kavramlar ileçözüm yöntemleri özeti verilecektir.)Birinci haftaİki değişkenli fonksiyonlardan hatırlatmalar: ikinci derece fonksiyonlar,kısmi türev ve iki katlı entegrallerdeki temel tanımlar ve geometridekianlamları; iki değişkenli fonksiyonlarda türev ve entegrallerdeki temelhesaplama yöntemleri, iki katlı entegral hesaplamasında sıranın önemininörneklerle hatırlatılması; teğet düzlem ve diferansiyel; tam türev vezincirleme türev.

Bu ders, birinci derstegeliştirilen temeller üzerine daha ileri konuları işlemekte ve daha kapsamlıuygulamalar ve çözümlü örnekler sunmaktadır. Ders gerçek yaşamdan gelenuygulamaları da tanıtmaya önem veren “içerikli yaklaşımla”tasarlanmıştır. Konuların sunumunda “ne?” ve “nasıl?” sorularının yanısı sıra, “neden?” ve“nerede?” sorularına da yanıt aranacaktır. İlk iki soru “tanım” ve “kanıt”larıoluşturuyor. Diğer iki soru da, konuların nereden geldiğini ve neredekullanılacağına yanıt veriyor.Matematikte konuları bir düzen içinde hazır cevaplar vererek geliştirmek(Aristo yöntemi) önemlidir. Bunun yanı sıra sorular sorup, öğrenciyle birlikteyanıtlamak da öğrenim için etkin bir yöntem (Sokrat yöntemi). Buradaki sunumdauygun durumlarda Sokrat yönteminden yararlanmaya özen gösterilmektedir. Niçin türev ve entegral? Yaşamın iki önemli göstergesi değişim ve birikimdir.Değişim farklarla ve birikim de toplamalarla tanımlanır. Özünde, diferansiyelhesap, ilkokuldan beri öğrenip uyguladığımız çıkarma ve toplama işlemlerininbir uzantısıdır. Diferansiyel hesaptaki yeni kavram anlık değişim ve değişkengirdilerden oluşan birikimin belirlenebilmesidir. Bu iki kavram sonsuz küçükdeğerleri gerektirir. İstenen anlık değişiklik ve birikim sonsuz küçüklerinsıfır olduğu limitte ulaşılan değerlerdir. Limit diferansiyel hesabın dayandığıtemel kavramdır.Bir fonksiyon, bir girdi (bağımsız değişken) ile çıktı (bağımlı değişken)arasındaki ilişkidir. Bağımlı değişkendeki değişimin, bağımsız değişkendekideğişime oranı “türev” kavramını getirir. Birikim de, örneğin kütleyi, elektrikyükünü, enerjiyi, uzunluğu, alanı, hacmi veren fonksiyonların bağımsızdeğişkendeki sonsuz küçük değerlerle ağırlıklı toplamıdır. Bu işlem “entegral”kavramıdır. İlkokuldan beri toplama ve çıkarmanın birbirinin tersi vetamamlayıcısı olduğunu biliyor ve kullanıyoruz. Bu ilişki türev ve entegraldede geçerlidir. Diferansiyel hesabın iki “temel teoremi” bu ilişkiyi kanıtlar:Bir fonksiyonun türevinin entegrali, başlangıçtaki fonksiyonu verir. Benzerolarak, bir fonksiyonun entegralinin türevi de başlangıçtaki fonksiyonu verir.Bu temel sonuçlar “Tek değişkenli fonksiyonların diferansiyel hesabı” dersindenbiliniyor. Bu ders aynı konuları temel alarak, kavram ve hesaplama yöntemleriniçok değişkenli fonksiyonlara geliştiriyor. Niçin çok değişkenli fonksiyonlar? Çünkü yaşamın gerçek konuları bir, ikiveya üç konum ve bir de zaman değişkeniyle belirleniyor. Ders tek değişkenlifonksiyonlarda öğrendiklerimizin üzerine yapılanıyor. Her yeni konuyabaşlarken, tek değişkenli fonksiyonlardaki eşdeğer durum hatırlatılacaktır. Bunedenle önceki dersin konularını hatırlatma, öğrenciye eksik bildiklerinitamamlama ve bildiklerini pekiştirme olanağını da veriyor. Dersin sonundaöğrenciler çok boyutta düşünebilme becerisini geliştirecek, çevreyi ve insanyapısı olan teknolojiyi gerçekçi anlamda kavrayabilecektir. (Kaynak: Attila Aşkar, “Çok değişkenli fonksiyonlarda türev ve entegral”.Bu kitap dört ciltlik dizinin ikinci cildidir. Dizinin diğer kitapları Cilt 1“Tek değişkenli fonksiyonlarda türev ve entegral”, Cilt 3: “Doğrusal cebir” veCilt 4: “Diferansiyel denklemler” dir.EnglishThe course is the second of the two course sequence of calculus ofmultivariable functions. The first course develops the concepts of derivativesand integrals of functions of several variables, and the basic tools for doingthe relevant calculations. This course builds on the foundations of the firstcourse and introduces more advanced topics along with more advancedapplications and solved problems. The course is designed with a “content-based”approach, i. e. by solving examples, as many as possible from real lifesituations.The “why” and “where“ of the topics are discussed, as much as the “what”and the “how”. The answers to the latter are the “definitions” and “proofs”,while the answers to the first two tell the reason for studying a topic, andthe areas where such ideas are used.The transfer of knowledge through an organized deductive process plays animportant role in mathematics (Aristotelian approach). An interactivecommunication between the teacher and the student through posing questions andanswering them leads to an effective method (Socratian method). The design ofthis course will benefit from the latter whenever feasible.Why do we study derivatives and integrals? Because derivatives expresschange, and integrals define the cumulative results of many inputs. Change andgrowth through time or space are two basic aspects of life. Change is expressedwith the difference between two situations, and the cumulative result of manyinputs is an additive process. Thus basically, calculus is an extension of whatwe all learn as early as first grade as addition and subtraction. Calculusenables us to define and calculate instantaneous changes and growth bycontinuously varying inputs. Instantaneity of the changes and variability of theinputs are handled by infinitesimal quantities. The final results are obtainedin the limit where the infinitesimal changes become zero. The limit is thecentral concept of calculus.A function defines the relationship between the inputs, which are the independentvariables, and outputs which are the dependent variables. The ratio of theinfinitesimal changes in the dependent variable to those of the independentvariable leads to the concept of the “derivative”. Similarly, the cumulativeoutputs of entities such as matter, energy, area, surface, volume, etc. arecalculated by the sum of the dependent variable weighted by the changes in theindependent variable. This operation leads to the concept of “integral”. Justlike in Grade One, where we observed that addition and subtraction are theinverses of each other, so are integral and derivative. This complementaritybetween the derivative and integral is expressed by the two “fundamentaltheorems of calculus”. All this is studied in the “Calculus of Single VariableFunctions”.Why multivariables? Because real life problems involve several variables.Our environment is defined by three space variables and phenomena evolve interms of a fourth which is time. People- made phenomena require many morevariables. The course offered here is built on the knowledge of calculus ofsingle variable functions and extends the concepts and techniques tomultivariable functions. The concepts and techniques are, in most cases,natural extensions and generalizations from those in single variable functions.Hence, each topic will start the review of the fundamental concepts andcalculation techniques from the calculus of one variable functions. This reviewis an opportunity to supplement what a student missed in the earlier course onsingle variables, while advancing into relevant problems from real life thatinvolve more than one variable.(Source: Attila Aşkar,Calculus of Multivariable Functions, Volume 2 of the set of Vol1: Calculus ofSingle Variable Functions, Volume 3: Linear Algebra and Volume 4: DifferentialEquations.

Thanks to spatial computing, a hiker in Yellowstone and a taxi driver in Manhattan can know precisely where    they are, discover nearby points of interest and learn how to reach their destinations. Spatial computing technology is what powers the Foursquare check-in, the maps app on your smartphone, the devices used by scientists to track endangered species,    the routing directions that help you get from point A to point B, the precision agriculture technology that is revolutionizing farming, and the augmented reality devices like Google Glass that may soon mediate our interaction with the real world.This course introduces the fundamental ideas underlying spatial computing services, systems, and sciences. Topics covered will include the nature of geospatial information, proper statistical frameworks for working with geospatial data, key algorithms    and data structures, spatial data mining, and cartography/geovisualization. We will also address applied topics such as where to find spatial data, how to use powerful open source software to analyze and map spatial data, and frameworks for building    location-based services.        Three Ways to Enjoy this Course:    This course is designed to support three different types of students and educational goals:    Curiosity Track: Most of us interact with spatial technologies every day. This track is for students who wish to learn about one or two spatial computing topics, but not commit to an entire course. Curiosity track students are not interested in    a certificate of accomplishment.    Concepts Track: This track is for students who want to learn about spatial computing concepts in order to make informed choices, but who are not programmers and do not have extensive experience with statistical methods. For example, concepts track    students will learn about Tobler’s First Law of geography and map projections, but will not delve into the quantifications of either. Students who complete the concepts track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Statement of Accomplishment.    Technical Track: This track builds on the concepts track, but adds math and programming. For example, we will cover spatial statistical indicators like Moran’s I and Ripley’s K when discussing Tobler’s First Law and will have students calculate    the distance between two points using two different coordinate systems and open-source APIs. Students who complete the technical track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Distinguished Statement of Accomplishment.

The past twodecades of research on learning, and more recent framings of academic goals(especially the Common Core State Standards) bring this insight to theforefront. This short course, designed for as few as four weeks and as manyas eight, asks how teachers can and do capitalize on what students bringto the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings – toadvance the learning of all students in the class.Our overarching goal is to support participants in developing the knowledge    and skills needed to take up student thinking in ways that enable all students    to learn challenging subject matter – a practice we call “leveraging student    thinking”.Course content will focus primarily on middle grades classrooms in various    disciplines, but the practice of leveraging student thinking is applicable    to all subject areas and grade levels. Participants will explore the design    of curricular tasks, the analysis of patterns of talk, and the use of representational    tools to:    elicit student thinking,    attend to significant features of that thinking,    interpret students’ ideas within a developmental framework, and    bridge from students’ current understandings to more sophisticated understandings.These ideas will be introduced through guided engagement with video cases.    Analysis of the video cases will highlight the elements involved in leveraging    student thinking, and also will illustrate the epistemic, academic, developmental    and managerial “pressure points” that challenge teachers’ ability to capitalize    on student thinking in constructive ways.Throughout the course, participants will further explore and test out these ideas in their own classrooms, be they formal or informal. (A Sunday school class, a scout troop, a homeschool opportunity, or a traditional classroom environment would all be appropriate, but some kind of teaching practice is necessary to benefit from the course.)  The goal is to work on the work of teaching while teaching.In addition, critical reflection with a group of partners is an important component of this course.  At key points, participants will be asked to document their work to share with peers for feedback. Therefore, we strongly encourage teachers to plan to work through this course in teams (of two to four people) to facilitate mutual observation, analysis and discussion. Teachers who do not have a team at the beginning of the course will be able to create a team through online forums at the beginning of the course and can exchange their teaching examples through video or narrative descriptions.','This course explores how teachers can capitalize on what students bring to the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings - to advance the learning of all students in the class, a practice we call “leveraging student thinking”.

Can the present world and Olympic records inathletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? Thiscourse provides the answer to these questions. It shows thataerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complexand that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are causedby the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly, the samecounter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in bothsports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course willhelp you to understand and improve the performance of top athletesand of modern building design. In2013, team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for aTour de France team time trial, with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25km, beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At thesubsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships, the latter team beatthe former by only 0.88 s. Clearly, even minor aerodynamicimprovements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And,surprisingly, up to now, the optimum aerodynamic setting for a teamtime trial has not yet been explored.Recordsin athletics races such as the 100 m sprint, the 110 m hurdles andthe long jump are only validated by the IAAF (InternationalAssociation of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tailwinds close to 2 m/s. Clearly, local aerodynamic effects can bedecisive in establishing new records. Also here, the optimumaerodynamic setting has not yet been explored.Newand prestigious building projects are realized in different parts ofthe world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energysystems in the building design. Also here, aerodynamic misconceptionscan lead to suboptimal performance. Thecourse starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects offluid flow: statics, kinematics, dynamics, flow regimes and boundarylayers, including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports andbuilding aerodynamics take place. Next, the main aspects of theaerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing andComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined. Tips andtricks for wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations are given. Thisknowledge provides the basis for the course parts on buildingaerodynamics, 100 m sprint aerodynamics and cycling aerodynamics,where some surprising and sometimes spectacular results will beshown.','Have we reached the boundaries of what can be achieved in sports and building design?

By this definition our Earth isvery much alive, with many eruptions each year and with a far greater number of“active volcanoes” that can potentially erupt in any given year. In detail, each eruption isdifferent. Every volcano is its own physical and chemical system, occurs in itsown geological location, is subjected to its local stress field, and is at itsown stage in evolution in geological time. External triggers of volcanic eruptions are also believed to play animportant role.Yet powerful generalisationsand models of volcanic eruptions are indeed possible and in fact very useful indealing with the consequences of volcanic eruptions.How are such modelsconstructed? They must rest on a basis of a mechanistic understanding of whatvolcanoes are, and what they are doing – not just during eruptions but also inthe events leading up to eruptions, and not just at the Earth´s surface butalso at depth, where the magma is being prepared for the next eruption.In addition tofield observations of past eruptions, monitoring of signals from magmaticsystems, and computer-based simulation of volcanic eruptions, increasingly,high pressure and high temperature experiments are employed in order to answerthe question of how volcanic systems work.These controlled laboratory conditionsfor experimental volcanology are transforming the study of volcanoes from achiefly observational discipline where eruptive mechanisms were developed viatheoretical analysis of such observations, into a fully modern scientificdiscipline where such theoretical approaches are either verified or rejected,by the experimental picture of what is possible and what is not.This course shows you how such experimental insight is obtained and what it tells us about erupting volcanoes.','Volcanic eruptions are a powerful demonstration of the energy of the Earth´s interior.

In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistancewas increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassedimmediate questions of decorative language (antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems ofconceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothicstructural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first,the new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system,and only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structuralconceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see normsand models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, firstaffirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance    architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance    theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces,    technology and forms in the XV century in Italy, from Leon Battista Alberti’s    to Francesco di Giorgio’s and Bramante’s proposals.','Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces, technology and forms looking to the antiquity in the XV century in Italy.','2-4 hours/week','Francesco  Paolo Fiore','Interest in History of Architecture and general knowledge of history of the Renaissance','null','null'),(344,'466','Introduction to International Criminal Law','https://www.coursera.org/course/intlcriminallaw','https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/7d/b9ca86812e37761e1d836fb37cd5a0/Untitled.png','casewestern','law','en','This course comprises eight units.Each will include an assigned reading, typically an article or book chapter, aswell as a simulation designed to bring the readings to life.I will offer video lectures on each ofthe topics, accompanied by slides.  In addition, there will be onlinerole-play exercises and debates, enabling the students to share their owninsights. The order of class sessions will be:(1)     History: FromNuremberg to The Hague(2)     InternationalCrimes Part 1: War Crimes, Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, and Torture(3)     International CrimesPart 2: Terrorism and Piracy(4)     Special modes ofliability: command responsibility, co-perpetration, and incitement(5)      Specialdefenses: insanity, obedience to orders, duress, and head of state immunity(6)      Gainingcustody of the accused: extradition, luring, abduction, and targeted killing(7)      Pre-TrialIssues: plea bargaining, self-representation, and exclusion of torture evidence(8)     Maintaining control of the courtroom    ','From the Nuremberg trial to the case against Saddam Hussein,from the prosecution of Al-Qaeda terrorists to the trial of Somali pirates – noarea of law is as important to world peace and security as internationalcriminal law.  Taught by one of the world’s leading experts in the field,this course will educate students about the fundamentals of internationalcriminal law and policy.  We will explore the contours of internationalcrimes such as genocide, war crimes, terrorism, and piracy.  We willexamine unique modes of international criminal liability and specializeddefenses.  And we will delve into the challenges of obtaining custody ofthe accused and maintaining control of the courtroom.','Taught by one of the world’s leading experts in the field, this course will educate students about the fundamentals of international criminal law and policy.

Dallo spazio e tempo assoluti e indipendenti si è passati ad una descrizione di un mondo in cui distanzeed intervalli di tempo dipendono da chi le osserva, in cui l’ordine di accadimento di due eventi non è univoco, in cui la velocità del tempo segnato da un orologio dipende da quali corpi si trovino vicino. Nel microscopico si è invece abbandonata la descrizionedella fisica classica, magari caotica, ma sempre deterministica, per arrivare ad una descrizione probabilistica, in cui gli stati e le proprietà del mondo microscopico non sono determinati, a priori, intrinsecamente, ma acquisiscono realtà solo se venganomisurati o se entrino in contatto con altri “oggetti”. L’abbandono della realtà locale, del fatto cioè che le azioni esercitate in un luogo, per particolari sistemi, possono avere effetti istantanei su oggetti a distanze virtualmente infinite, stravolgonola descrizione di un mondo che fino al secolo scorso sembrava sensato e ragionevole.

We can use knowledge of animal physiology and both normaland abnormal behaviour as complementary approaches in the assessment of thewelfare of an animal in its captive environment. We can also employexperimental techniques to try to understand animal emotions in relation to their living conditions, for example; to determine their preferences, or what they don\'t like or find aversive about a  procedure or environment. These experimental techniques allow us to ‘ask’the animals how they feel about their environment. In week 2 we will explore avariety of techniques used practically and experimentally to provide an insightinto the animal’s experience of its world.  Week3: Practical Animal Welfare: Companion Animal WelfareInmany countries dogs and cats are traditionally kept as pets in the home, withstray/abandoned or unwanted animals usually housed in shelters, where there arefrequently questions about their behavioural needs. In other parts of the worlddogs and cats may exist very successfully as part of a ‘community’ or as‘street’ animals, and this existence also presents unique challenges andbenefits to the welfare of these species. In this lecture we will explore theplace of dogs and cats in human society and how different attitudes andmanagement styles impact on their welfare. Week4: Practical Animal Welfare: Production Animal WelfareProduction animal welfare is a hot topic. In thissession you will gain an appreciation of the relevance of farm animal welfareand the issues that impact on production animal species.  We shall also look at the way that scientistshave contributed to our understanding of the importance of these impacts froman animal\'s point of view. We will explore societal concerns, the scientificunderstanding of animal welfare within a variety of production methods and howwe gain insight to the animal\'s viewpoint.  Week5: Practical Animal Welfare: Captive Wild Animal WelfareDuringthe fifth week we will summarise key welfare issues relating to the managementof captive wild animals in zoos. Primarily conservation-focussed, the zoo community isbecoming increasingly aware of the welfare concerns arising from the managementof captive wild animals and is developing strategies to address these issues.We will look at the conflicts between welfare and conservation, the methods forassessing welfare within a zoo environment and the challenges associated withthis.','Animals occupy a huge part of the planet andour lives, and although we rely on them for all aspects of our own wellbeing - food, draught power, medical advances, clothing, sport as well as pleasure,protection and comfort - often their quality of life is questionable. Appreciating how animal\'s experience the world they live in and the different behavioural needs of the various species we interact with, enables us to gain a better understanding of their welfare requirements, so that long term improvements to animal lives can be made.  There are now more than 60 billionland animals raised for meat each year around the world, and withincreasing human populations and a rise in meat consumption in many parts of the world, these figures are set to double by 2050. Added to this is a huge and growing world population of dogs and cats, many of whom are strays with associated health and welfare issues.  International concern for animal welfarecontinues to grow with rising demand for measures to protect animals andimprove their care and wellbeing. The link between animal welfare and humanwellbeing is clear, and yet we still have a long way to go if we are to addresswelfare needs globally. Finding ways to achieve higher standards of animal welfare, is therefore a key priority for any developed and developing nation. Due to gaining in importance internationally, there is increasing recognition of the need for animal welfare issues to be addressed objectively in a scientifically credible manner. In this animal behaviour and welfare course, you will learn about animal welfare and why it matters, develop an understanding of some of the main welfare issues animals have to cope with as well as gaining an insight into the behavioural needs and the emotions of dogs, cats, farmed animals and    captive wildlife.    This course is delivered collaboratively by academics from the University of Edinburgh and Scotland\'s Rural College (SRUC).     ','Animal welfare has been described as a complex, multi-faceted public policy issue which includes important scientific, ethical, and other dimensions. Improving our understanding of  animal welfare, involves the fascinating study of animal behavior as well as the challenge of accessing the emotions of animals.

Week 4: ‘Space Symmetry’expands the symmetry operations to include 3 dimensional motion.  The methodology for reading and using thesymmetry diagrams of the 17 plane groups and 230 space groups is introduced.Part III:Symmetry in CrystalsWeek 5: ‘Atoms in Crystal Structures’ looks the external shape of mineral crystals byvisiting a geomancer. The manner in which crystal faceting reflects theinternal atomic arrangements is described. ‘PolyhedralProperties’ shows that regular geometrical shapes can be derived fromfolding plane nets to create Platonic and Archimedean solids that oftendescribe atomic clustering.Week 6: ‘Planes, Directions and Unit Cell’introduces the mathematics for describing perfect crystal structures and alsothe appearance of defects or asymmetry that are important aesthetically andtechnologically.

A clean room fabricationfacility provides real world context for exploiting chemically-driven symmetry.Week 8:  ‘Building Complex Structures’ looks beyond 3 dimensional symmetry to higher dimensional repetitions found in some Islamic tilings and the incommensurate crystal structures. ‘Technological and Design Implications’ returns to the everyday appearance ofsymmetry that can now be explored quantitatively. ','Symmetry is everywhere. In thegrand scheme of things it is the blueprint by which the universeoperates. We see symmetry in nature, art, architecture, science andengineering. This course explores the Beauty, Form and Function of Symmetryin common objects, then progresses to investigate tiling and tessellation, gemsand crystals, and finally its indispensable role in technology. Walk through an urban or rural landscape and you are immersed in an endless variety of forms, often taken for granted, because our minds have evolved to perceive symmetry in our surroundings so as to accelerate the flight or fight response. Symmetry and asymmetry are also key factors that ensure the successful reproduction of plants and animals. For example, the bilateral symmetry of orchids is widely admired and this geometry is essential for insects to successfully pollinate these flowers.This course will give you the means to address severalfundamental questions.  What tags do we recognize in decorativearrangements? What guidelines shape the patterns in the world around us? Whatfunctions do these symmetrical patterns serve? From looking at minerals and crystallography and also observing patterns and forms at the atomic scale, important in drugdesign, materials synthesis, and data storage devices, students will appreciate how today\'s advancement in technology, is in no small part aconsequence of humankind’s increasingly sophisticated and precise manipulationof symmetry.To amplify these ideas, you will undertake field-exercises and beintroduced to specialists – botanists, artists, geomancers, historians,scientists and engineers - that work with symmetry, and who will provide theirpersonal insights into its ‘magic’ and impact on their disciplines.At the conclusion of this study, youwill possess the tools and the motivation to look at symmetry with even greaterdelight, wonder and appreciation!Important note: The course will be launched on 17 Feb 2014.

War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When the first    steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at preventing    the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War Two,    the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never    have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the    supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities    consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members – and    deepen – from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities    to the current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence.

This challenges lawmakers to tackle    difficult questions about the continued existence of the Euro and the future    direction of the European integration project.This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU,    a vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the    legal systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided into three    parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the    development of the EU, its institutional structure and functioning, and    the specific nature and sources of EU law. In the second part, we will    examine how EU law impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies    that are established or provide services in the EU.

The course will focus on the following topics:Brain death and persistent vegetative state When is a person dead? In many countries death is now defined as “brain death,” but is this way of understanding death justified? How we define death is important, because it is connected to critical questions such as: When is organ donation permissible?When is it right to take someone off life support? And how should we treat individuals who are in a persistent vegetative state?Abortion and the moral status of embryos and fetus Most people would argue that it is always wrong to intentionally take the life of an innocent human being. This belief is often expressed in terms of support for the “sanctity of human life.” Is abortion or embryo research compatible with this idea? Doesan embryo have a right to life from the beginning of conception, or is this right something it acquires gradually? When, if ever, is abortion justified?Making end of life decisions How do you distinguish wrongful killing from acts that are not regarded as wrong? Can it ever be right to end the life of someone who cannot express a view about whether he or she wants to live or die? How should we make life and death decisions for severelyill infants? And can euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide be justified?Effective altruismWe all spend money on items that are not necessities. In other parts of the world, people die for the want of food or medicines that cost a few cents. The common view is that giving to poor people in other countries is charity, something that is goodto do, but not wrong if we don’t. But is that really true? This topic concerns what our responsibility is for people less well of than us, what the best cause is, and what good career choices are. How much we ought to do for others?Climate change On what principles should nations agree on the extent of their emissions of greenhouse gasses? Should the nations that have contributed most to climate change compensate the nations that are suffering, and will suffer, most from it? Or should some otherprinciple of justice govern the way we allocate quotas for greenhouse gas emissions?Animals It is common to draw a sharp line between how we are allowed to treat human beings and what we are allowed to do to animals. We consider cannibalism abhorrent, but routinely raise and kill animals for food. We set strict guidelines for experimenting onhuman beings, but much more lax ones for experimenting on animals. Is this attitude to animals justifiable? One way to put this question is to ask: “Do animals have rights?” But the debate does not have to revolve around animal rights. It can also beput in terms of the idea of equality, and where it stops—that is, does equality only apply to human beings? This topic concerns how we should treat animals, and when experimentation on animals is justified.Environmental values It is one thing to argue that we can extend ethics beyond the boundary of our own species, to other sentient beings, but it is a quite different thing to hold that there is also intrinsic value in something that cannot feel anything, like plants, or isn’teven alive, like mountains and streams. Can such a claim be justified? If it cannot, what difference does it make to the case for wilderness protection?Why act ethically? Many of you might reach the conclusion that the ethical life can be a demanding one. So why bother? Why act ethically, rather than doing whatever you please? This is an ancient question, which some philosophers have dismissedas illegitimate, and others have sought to answer, in various ways. It leads us to questions about the meaning of life, and what it is to lead a good life.This course will introduce you to some of the ways philosophers have approached these questions, as well as some of their answers. You will also be encouraged to question your own ethical beliefs, and in the process explore the extent to which reasonand argument can play a role in everyday ethical decision-making.','Is abortion wrong? Should we eat animals? What is our responsibility to the world’s poor?

PHILOSOPHY AND THE PHYSICAL SCIENCESWeek 1. The origin of our universe (Michela Massimi and John Peacock)How did our universe form andevolve? Was there really a Big Bang,and what came before it? In this class, we take you through the history ofcontemporary cosmology and we look at how scientists arrived at the currentunderstanding of our universe. We look at the history of astronomy, with thenebular hypothesis back in the eighteenth century, and in more recent times,Einstein’s general relativity and the ensuing cosmological models. Finally, weexplain the current Standard Model and early universe cosmology and theexperimental evidence behind it.  Week 2. What are dark matter and dark energy? (Michela Massimi and JohnPeacock) According to the currently accepted model in cosmology, our universe is made up of 5% of ordinary matter, 25% cold dark matter, and 70% dark energy. But what kind of entities are dark matter and dark energy? In this class, we take you through a fascinating    journey at the frontiers of contemporary cosmology and particle physics. We also look at alternative theories that explain the same experimental evidence without recourse to the hypothesis of dark matter and dark energy and we discuss the rationale    for choosing between rival research programs. Week 3. The Anthropic Reasoning in Philosophy and Cosmology (Alasdair Richmondand John Peacock) Anthropic reasoning attempts to understand peculiarities of the physical universe via context-sensitive observers in a multiverse of different distinct universes. Anthropic reasoning can explain the dimensionality of space (and time), the ratio of gravitational    and electromagnetic forces, the valency of carbon bonds, and the ages of the stars we observe in the night sky. Other anthropic explanations suggest that our universe ought to be a gigantic time machine and that we may live inside a ‘Matrix’-style    computer-simulated reality. In this class, we review the problems and prospects of anthropic reasoning by drawing on cutting-edge research in galaxy formation.    PART II. PHILOSOPHY AND THE COGNITIVE SCIENCESWeek 4. Stone-age minds in modern skulls:evolutionary theory and the philosophy of mind (Suilin Lavelle and Kenny Smith)This week, we will explore scientific interpretations of how our minds evolved, and some of the methodologies used in forming these interpretations.  We will relate evolutionary debates to a core issue in the philosophy of mind, namely, whether all    knowledge comes from experience, or whether we have ‘inborn’ knowledge about certain aspects of our world.Week 5. What is consciousness? (Mark Sprevak and David Carmel)One of the hardest problems inscience is the nature of consciousness. We know that we have consciousness. Wedo not just blindly process information, make discriminations, take actions. Italso feels a certain way to do sofrom the inside. Why do creatures with brains like ours have consciousness?What makes certain bits of our mental life conscious and others not? Thesequestions form the heart of consciousnessscience, an exciting field to which psychologists, neuroscientists andphilosophers contribute. This session will explore these questions, andintroduce some recent progress that has been made towards answering them.Week 6. Intelligent machines and the human brain (Mark Sprevak and Peggy Series)How does one make a cleveradaptive machine that can recognise speech, control an aircraft, and detectcredit card fraud? Recent years have seen a revolution in the kinds of taskscomputers can do. Underlying these advances is the burgeoningfield of machine learning andcomputational neuroscience. The same methods that allow us to make clevermachines also appear to hold the key to understanding ourselves: to explaininghow our brain and mind work. We explore this exciting new field and some of thephilosophical questions that it raises.Week 7. EmbodiedCognition (Andy Clark and Barbara Webb) Cognitive Science has recentlytaken a strongly \'embodied turn\', recognizing that biologically evolvedintelligence makes the most of the opportunities provided by bodily form,action, and the material and social environment. This session explores the waythis impacts our vision of minds, brains, and intelligent agents, and askswhether there can be a fundamental science of the embodied mind.','    What is the origin of our universe? What are dark matter and dark energy? What is our role in the universe as human agents capable of knowledge? What makes us intelligent cognitive agents seemingly endowed with consciousness? Scientific research across both the physical sciences and the cognitive sciences has raised pressing questions for philosophers. The goal of this course is to introduce you to some of the main areas and topics at the key juncture between philosophy and    the sciences. The course is structured around two broad areas:     Philosophy and the Physical Sciences    Philosophy and the Cognitive Sciences                    Each week we will introduce you to some of these important questions at the forefront of scientific research. We will explain the science behind each topic in a simple, non-technical way, while also addressing the philosophical and conceptual questions    arising from it. Areas you’ll learn about will include:            Philosophy of cosmology, where we’ll consider questions about the origin and evolution of our universe, the nature of dark energy and dark matter and the role of anthropic reasoning in the explanation of our universe.    Philosophy of psychology, among whose issues we will cover the evolution of the human mind and the nature of consciousness.    Philosophy of neurosciences, where we’ll consider the nature of human cognition and the relation between mind, machines, and the environment.                        Learning Objectives    Gain a fairly well-rounded view on selected areas and topics at the intersection of philosophy and the sciences    Understand some key questions, and conceptual problems arising in the natural sciences and cognitive sciences.

Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people (so-called bad apples). However, numerous corporate scandals, such as Enron, Ford, or Siemens, have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a corrupt context. Good apples may become rotten in bad barrels. Regardless of their good intentions and strong values, individual actors might adapt to the unethical practices in their respective organizational context and, over time, lose the ability to see their wrongdoings. They become ethically blind. Such changes in people’s way of seeing the world and their value systems can occur in—and through—various organizational contexts in business, civil society, and public administration.

We will also provide different perspectives from international entrepreneurs and thought leaders who will compare and contrast their experience on a particular topic with their counterparts in Northeast Ohio. We will cover the following topics during the course:Government SupportEngaging Philanthropy and DonorsCreating Intermediary OrganizationsLeveraging Anchor InstitutionsSeed AccelerationFostering Angel InvestmentAccess to Venture Capital','The path for entrepreneurs to grow their companies outside of well-developed entrepreneurial ecosystems like Silicon Valley is challenging. Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other modelsto support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs.Northeast Ohio, whose largest city is Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course, we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches.A massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financingstartups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but whether or not they\'ve hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop. Government officialsand donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging.During this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety ofprograms and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined.In addition to learning about Cleveland\'s attempts to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia, Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth of start-up companies.One of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses. Taking what we\'ve learned from our examples in class, I will ask you to reflect on how tobest grow entrepreneurship where you live. I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information flows in multiple directions.Most MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures, but this course will be different. Don’t expect to see me standing in front of the camera, talking and lecturing every week. Instead, the lectures will be relatively short in length andwill have more of the feel of an engaging documentary than a static classroom setting.

This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that “(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics.” This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.

Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors.In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of event-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, which are also programming projects.Personalized Tutoring by Typesafe: Typesafe offers supervised tutorial sessions accompanying select Coursera classes.

At the same time writing efficient computer programs    to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.    Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve    a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce    parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.     Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,    computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.Although parallel computing will be covered, this is not a class    on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days    have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars.

After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and    a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.High performance programming is also an important aspect of high    performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course    is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as    a computational scientist.','Programming-oriented course on effectively using modern computers to solve scientific computing problems arising in the physical/engineering sciences and other fields.

Transcripts     of the video lectures. Links     and handouts mentioned in video lectures. One     or more announcements from     the instructor every week. Discussion forums.     These forums will help you apply the material by interacting with other     students in the course.  One     weekly quiz for each of modules 1-4 that covers the video lectures. These quizzes     are previewed as embedded questions throughout the video lectures. Study     guide to prepare for the cumulative mid-point quiz. A     mid-point quiz consisting     of 20 questions. You may take the mid-point quiz twice. The highest score     will be counted. The mid-point quiz is cumulative, covering the first 4     weeks of material. It is an open-note and independent activity. Modules     5, 6, & 7 each require a assignment that     will be graded by your peers. Modules     5, 6, & 7 each require you to complete 3 peer assessments (9). Optional supplemental     social media interaction using #ksuitecmoocCollaborationWe highly recommend that teacher groups or whole schools take the course together. Meeting once per week in a face-to-face environment to discuss, share resources, and peer critique is advised; however, each person should complete independent assignments…no    group projects. Your projects may be closely related, though. For example, in this course you will design a blended or online unit for your class. If a grade level team at the same school decides to divide up the curriculum such that each teacher    designs a separate social studies unit for his/her grade level team, then the grade level team’s projects would closely relate while not becoming a single group project.

There are two types of groupdecision making problems that we will discuss in this course. A voting problem: Supposethat a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on whichrestaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But, how should the friends decide whereto go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find achoice that is “fair” taking into account everyone’s opinions or must we choose one personfrom the group to act as a “dictator”? A fair division problem: Suppose that there is a cake anda group of hungry children. Naturally, you want to cut the cake and distribute the piecesto the children as fairly as possible. If the cake is homogeneous (e.g., a chocolate cake withvanilla icing evenly distributed), then it is easy to find a fair division: give each child a piecethat is the same size.

Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning in NLP.','Natural language processing (NLP) deals with the application of computational models to text or speech data. Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation.

Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.    Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.     Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.    We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication.     In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.','Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.

Не всегда, к сожалению, здравый смысл оказывается достаточно просвещенным и тренированным. Экономические понятия, которыми мы мыслим, складывались в разные эпохи и несут, порой, совсем не тот смысл, который мы по инерции в них вкладываем. Мы копим деньги, порой, так, как это делали наши предки столетия тому назад, хотя деньги тогда были из драгоценных металлов, а ныне они бумажные. Мы легко ссылаемся на рост ВВП, плохо осознавая, что за этим стоит. Мы верим обещаниям политиков сделать нашу жизнь богатой и счастливой, не различая, каким обещаниям можно верить, а какими нас откровенно обманывают.   История экономической мысли – это квинтэссенция опыта решения сложных проблем хозяйственной жизни; опыта, который складывался в борьбе идей, отражавших конфликтующие социальные интересы. В нашем курсе обобщаются уроки выдающихся экономических мыслителей: Адама Смита и Карла Маркса, Леона Вальраса и Йозефа Шумпетера, Торстейна Веблена и Николая Кондратьева, Джона М. Кейнса и др. Мы будем разбираться в том, как, отвечая на вызовы своего времени, они создавали корпус современного экономического знания с его возможностями и ограничениями. Тем самым мы рассчитываем сделать ваш экономический здравый смысл более тренированным и просвещенным.We tend to make everyday economic decisions – what to buy, what job to choose, how to save one\'s income – without complicated calculations, instead relying on common sense.Unfortunately, common sense does not always appear to be enlightened andtrained enough.Economic conceptions, with which we think, were shapedin different epochs and often bear not that very sense we tend to put intothem. We sometimes accumulate money in a way our predecessors did, although atthat time it was gold or silver, while now we deal with just paper. We easilyrefer to GDP, being hardly aware of complexities behind this notion. We believeto politicians promising to make our life wealthy and happy, not distinguishingreliable promises from those just fooling us. History of economic thought is a distillation of experiences in solving complicatedproblems of economic life – experiences that were shaped in struggle of ideaswith conflicting social interests behind them. In our course we summarizelessons of outstanding economic thinkers, such as Adam Smith and Karl Marx,Leon Walras and Joseph Schumpeter, Torstein Veblen and Nikolai Kondratieff,John M. Keynes and others. We shall analyze how responding to the challenges oftheir times they created the corps of our economic knowledge with its powersand limitations. Thus we hope to make your economic common sense moreenlightened and better trained.','Курс поможет осмыслить извечные проблемы жизни человека: богатство и бедность, деньги и рынки, инфляция и безработица, индивидуальные решения и государственная политика.The course will help you to understand the lasting economic problems of everyday human life: wealth and poverty, money and markets, inflation and unemployment, human decisions and governmental policies.

In this module,we’ll explore the scope of the maternal mortality and morbidity in the UnitedStates, the inequalities and inequities between and within subpopulations ofthe country. Week Three: The Impactof the Health Care Workforce Shortage on Maternal and Newborn CareThe global health careworkforce shortage is leading to understaffed hospitals and shuttered healthclinics across the world. Because of this dangerous shortage, patients are left without thecritical care they need for survival. This shortage is exceptionally acute indeveloping countries such as Sub-Saharan Africa, which carries nearly 25% ofthe world’s disease burden but only 3% of the world’s health care workforce.This module will cover strategies to alleviate the shortage and maldistributionof the health care workforce in developing countries—particularly among nurses,midwives, and other skilled providers of maternal and newborn care. Week Four: Emergency Obstetric Care: Health Facility Servicesthat Support Maternal and Newborn CareInconjunction with increasing the global maternal health workforce, healthsystems must be strengthened to enable the provision of life-savinginterventions that cannot be delivered at the community level. The primarymeans of achieving this goal is through the implementation of emergencyobstetric care (EmOC) in health facilities. The main objectives of this lectureare to: review the rationale for EmOC, identify its “signal functions,”understand the United Nations process indicators for monitoring EmOC, describemonitoring and quality improvement approaches, and recognize key challenges toeffective implementation of EmOC in developing country contexts.Week Five: ImprovingMaternal and Newborn Care through Community-Based Interventions Community mobilization is a promising strategy forimproving access to/use of maternal and newborn health services. This module providesan understanding of how delivery of maternal and newborn care might be improvedthrough community-based interventions that effectively include and engage thecommunity in identifying and implementing sustainable solutions. Week Six: Case Studyin Ethiopia: Educating the Community and Training Front-Line Community HealthWorkers to Deliver Maternal and Newborn CareIn Ethiopia about 90% of births occur at home, andan estimated 22,000 women and 100,000 newborns die annually from childbirth-relatedcomplications. This module describes a projectthat uses an innovative community-based strategy to ensure that more women andnewborns in this country receive effective and timely care. The Maternal andNewborn Health in Ethiopia Partnership (MaNHEP) educates pregnant women and familieson safe birth and postnatal care practices, and trains frontline health workersto deliver a basic package of life-saving maternal and newborn care that cansignificantly improve health and survival (including referral to higher levelsof the health care system). ','This course gives a broadoverview of the maternal and newborn health issues facing developing countries,where more than 2.6 million babies are stillborn and nearly 500,000 women dieduring childbirth or from pregnancy complications each year. In the developingworld, many women deliver at home without the support of skilled healthproviders and modern technology. Maternal and newborn survival can be improvedby health systems strengthening emergency obstetric and newborn care whileoptimizing the health workforce to increase access to basic maternal andnewborn health care services through task-shifting.Through lectures, casestudies, and readings, course participants will learn about maternal andnewborn health delivery challenges across the world and how to utilizecommunity-based strategies to improve survival rates for mothers and babies.','This course will discuss the global health implications of pregnancy and childbirth in the developing world, where millions of women and babies die from complications during pregnancy, childbirth, and the months after childbirth.

We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project. The fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.So why use this approach? One reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  A third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.','This course is the second semester of the two semester sequence, Chemistry Concept Development and Application.

In order to study the behavior of such functions we’ll need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. We’ll begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons? Once we’ve answered these questions we’ll devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers, how they behave in limiting processes, etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions, and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of these that’s quite alright, but do look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set for example to see some beautiful pictures).When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation – a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Don’t worry! We’ll help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.  After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places, a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We’ll explore these properties! Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly we’ll have to learn about integration as well. But we are in the complex plane, so what are the objects we’ll integrate over? Curves! We’ll study these as well, and we’ll tie everything together via Cauchy’s beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.   Throughout this course we\'ll tell you about some of the major theorems in the field (even if we won\'t be able to go into depth about them) as well as some outstanding conjectures.

What do we know of the world? Mostly we know where most people liveand whether they are richer or poorer. This module reexamines the patterns ofworld demographics and economic development. 2.     Globalisation.Over the past half century or more, the World has become more interdependent.In the ‘hyperglobalist’ literature this is attributed to a reduced role of thestate and the victory of market forces. But economic markets are politicalconstructions, without which transactions will not happen.3.     Trust.Underlying all human activity is the concept of trust. At the extreme, thecomplete absence of trust, individuals fall back on closed circles offriendship and kinship and they will ‘privatise’ their involvement in publicinstitutions. In the ensuing uncertainty, businesses will cut back theirplanning perspectives and societies will start to fragment. 4.     Diversityor Fragmentation. Cultural differences can enrich societies, but underdifferent circumstances, they also serve to undermine social cohesion, and weakenthe foundations of trust.  Extremes inincome distribution, whether geographically or individually, may also havenegative effects for society as a whole. 5.     Governance.Governance is thechannel through which trust is linked to policy outcomes, such as growth andprosperity (and egalitarian policies). Poor institutional quality underminestrust, which in turn impacts on growth and prosperity. It also affects theability of states to fulfil their international obligations. 6.     EconomicDevelopment and Social Change. Helping to promote economic development in othercountries has been an international concern since the end of the second WorldWar. Having seen decades of  failure of development aid to close theincome gaps, the current orthodoxy is prioritizing the implementation of market orientedinstitutional reform.7.     (International)Institutions. The globalized economy is controlled and regulated by a networkof international organizations. There is some debate about the extent to whichthey serve to modify state behavior, and it is also important to rememberthat  they are also reflect theinternational power balance. 8.     Non-StateActors. Despite the focus of so much literature and analysis on the level ofnation states, it is businesses that trade, not states. And it is internationalfinance, rather than international trade, that is responsible for most of thequalitative transformation of the globalized world economy. ','The course is composed of eight modules that together will introduce students to the influences that shape the world in which we live today.

Why Content Strategy is essential for professionals in any organization – business,non-profit, or government.Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. Itstarts a “conversation” with users and stakeholders inside and outsidean organization.  Conversations are the natural way people think aboutcomplex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop “stories,”which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategypractitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises – in all departmentsand sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know thatif they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond theirjob descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier– creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that isvalued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make theirenterprise stand out.Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategypractitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobilemedia to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategiccontent they produce enhances the audience’s lives and deepens theirunderstanding and engagement with the organization.Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but itis done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditionaljournalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is notadvertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because itnever pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines. ','The Content Strategy MOOC is for professionals at all levels of an organization who want to significantly improve their abilities to understand audiences and develop strategic words, pictures, graphics, and videos to convey their organization’s most important goals.','3-6 hours/week','Bobby Calder, Candy Lee, Randy Hlavac, Andrew Gruen, John Lavine and Rachel Davis Mersey','This MOOC serves professionals who want to learn to create trustable,engaging and often interactive content to advance their enterprise’s future.This MOOC is for people anywhere in an organization who have content developmentexperience and now want to significantly improve their abilities to understandaudiences and develop strategic words, pictures, graphics and videos toconvey their organization’s most important goals.','null','null'),(491,'487','Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors','https://www.coursera.org/course/physics1','https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a6/9827ee8f978e6fe67ae6585d5fa814/CourseraLogo.jpg','boulder','physics','en','Week 1:                1D motion: speed, velocity and accelerationWeek 2:               1D motion continued.  Vector Math.Week 3:               Motion in 2D.Week 4:               Newton’s Laws.Week 5:               Applications of Newton’s Laws.  Friction.Week 6:               Work and Energy.Week 7:               Conservation of Energy.

We have more democracies in the world, and    yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students    of international relations.This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued    in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively    simple enough, but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is    my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given    in the course by developing your own analytical capacity.','This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued in the current research on peace and security.

He rejected the powerof kings in favor of ordinary people, believing that all men are created equaland possess inherent natural rights. Jefferson became a powerful spokesman fora revolutionary generation of Americans who created a new nation based on theseradical ideas. Thomas Jefferson remains today a pivotal figure inAmerican history whose influence continues to be felt nearly two centuriesafter his death, both in the United States and around the world.  Thiscourse will offer an introduction to Jefferson’s thought, focusing on severalkey ideas and themes that engaged Jefferson throughout his public career andprivate life.  We will address the three achievements that Jefferson askedto be listed on his tombstone by discussing his roles in writing the Declarationof Independence, in advocating religious freedom, and in advancing the cause ofeducation by founding the University of Virginia.  We will also seek tounderstand what Jefferson meant when he proclaimed that “the earth belongs tothe living.”  And, crucially, we will explore Jefferson’s lifelongrelationship with the institution of slavery.Tounderstand Jefferson’s ideas and why they continue to be relevant today, ourapproach in each lecture will be to situate Jefferson in the context of his owntime and place.  Jefferson lived for many years in differentplaces—Philadelphia, New York, Paris, and Washington D.C., to name but afew—but there is little doubt that he considered his home, Monticello, and thenearby town of Charlottesville, in central Virginia, to be the center of hisworld.  In this course, produced by the University of Virginia in closepartnership with the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, we will explore howJefferson’s identification with Monticello and the surrounding area influencedhim as he formulated ideas that have made a global impact.  Aftercompleting the course it should be clear not only why Jefferson\'s legacy isessential to understanding American history, but also why UNESCO has designatedJefferson’s Monticello and the University of Virginia as a World Heritage Site.','This is a six week course providing an overview of Thomas Jefferson\'s work and perspectives presented by the University of Virginia in partnership with Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello.

These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldn’t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!).There are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But don’t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. This class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you\'ll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you\'ll put everything together.Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins)What is Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it?In this lesson, you’ll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes)In this lesson you’ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. You’ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, you’ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, you’ll learn about:Salesforce Data: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. You’ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. Relationships: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you’ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. Validation Rules: If you’ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to build them into your app. Formulas and Summaries: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson you’ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app.  Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins)Behind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson you’ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which you’ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: One-to-Many Relationships: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you’ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.Data Loading: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins)No matter what kind of app you’re building, you’ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson you’ll learn how quickly communicate information with  real-time data visualizations. Specifically, you’ll learn how to make:Reports: These let you gather related information into one place.  These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. Charts: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.Dashboards: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.Views: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins)In this lesson you’ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. You’ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: Workflows: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.Approval Processes: You don’t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say “this looks good.” Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins)This is it. With a few clicks of the mouse you’ll make your app social and mobile. The tools you’ll use are:Chatter: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together.  Salesforce1: That web app you’ve been building this whole time? It’s actually a mobile app too. You’ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours)By the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now it’s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.','After completing this course you will have built your own web and mobile app. You will become familiar with the concept of abstraction and how to think about concrete problems in their most general sense -- a concept critical for all developers. In addition, you will learn how to map out a data model, create data visualizations, and automate manual processes after analyzing your abstractions.What kind of apps can you build?
